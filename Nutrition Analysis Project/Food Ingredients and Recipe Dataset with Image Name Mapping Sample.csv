0,Miso-Butter Roast Chicken With Acorn Squash Panzanella,"['1 (3½–4-lb.) whole chicken', '2¾ tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more', '2 small acorn squash (about 3 lb. total)', '2 Tbsp. finely chopped sage', '1 Tbsp. finely chopped rosemary', '6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus 3 Tbsp. room temperature', '¼ tsp. ground allspice', 'Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '⅓ loaf good-quality sturdy white bread, torn into 1"" pieces (about 2½ cups)', '2 medium apples (such as Gala or Pink Lady; about 14 oz. total), cored, cut into 1"" pieces', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '½ small red onion, thinly sliced', '3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar', '1 Tbsp. white miso', '¼ cup all-purpose flour', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature', '¼ cup dry white wine', '2 cups unsalted chicken broth', '2 tsp. white miso', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper']","Pat chicken dry with paper towels, season all over with 2 tsp. salt, and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour.
Meanwhile, halve squash and scoop out seeds. Run a vegetable peeler along ridges of squash halves to remove skin. Cut each half into ½""-thick wedges; arrange on a rimmed baking sheet.
Combine sage, rosemary, and 6 Tbsp. melted butter in a large bowl; pour half of mixture over squash on baking sheet. Sprinkle squash with allspice, red pepper flakes, and ½ tsp. salt and season with black pepper; toss to coat.
Add bread, apples, oil, and ¼ tsp. salt to remaining herb butter in bowl; season with black pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.
Place onion and vinegar in a small bowl; season with salt and toss to coat. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until ready to serve.
Place a rack in middle and lower third of oven; preheat to 425°F. Mix miso and 3 Tbsp. room-temperature butter in a small bowl until smooth. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then rub or brush all over with miso butter. Place chicken in a large cast-iron skillet and roast on middle rack until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 50–60 minutes. (Temperature will climb to 165°F while chicken rests.) Let chicken rest in skillet at least 5 minutes, then transfer to a plate; reserve skillet.
Meanwhile, roast squash on lower rack until mostly tender, about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and scatter reserved bread mixture over, spreading into as even a layer as you can manage. Return to oven and roast until bread is golden brown and crisp and apples are tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven, drain pickled onions, and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving dish.
Using your fingers, mash flour and butter in a small bowl to combine.
Set reserved skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. You should have about ¼ cup, but a little over or under is all good. (If you have significantly more, drain off and set excess aside.) Add wine and cook, stirring often and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until bits are loosened and wine is reduced by about half (you should be able to smell the wine), about 2 minutes. Add butter mixture; cook, stirring often, until a smooth paste forms, about 2 minutes. Add broth and any reserved drippings and cook, stirring constantly, until combined and thickened, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in miso. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.

Whisk anchovies, garlic, 3 Tbsp. mayonnaise, 1 Tbsp. mustard, 1 Tbsp. oil, and 1½ tsp. pepper in a small bowl. Set aside 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo in another small bowl.
Pat chicken dry; season outside and inside all over with salt. Arrange breast side up in a cast-iron skillet and tuck wings underneath. Arrange shallots around (if using legs, nestle under and around); season with salt and pepper. Brush remaining anchovy mayo all over chicken, making sure to get it into the nooks and crannies, then brush shallots with any leftover anchovy mayo.
Place chicken in oven so legs are facing toward the back (this is the hottest part of the oven and will help the legs cook before the breast dries out) and roast until some anchovy mayo and fat begin to drip onto shallots, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and, using tongs, turn shallots to coat in drippings. Return skillet to oven and continue to roast chicken, stirring shallots once or twice, until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breast registers 155°F, 45–55 minutes. If skin starts to get too dark on the top before chicken is done, tent area with foil, leaving the rest of the bird exposed. If using chicken legs, start checking at 40 minutes (a thermometer inserted right at the joint should register 160°F). Transfer chicken and shallots to a cutting board, leaving behind any juices and fat in skillet. If shallots need more time to soften and darken, roast a bit longer without chicken before proceeding. Reserve skillet.
Reduce oven temperature to 400°F. Finely grate half of zest of 1 lemon into a large bowl; cut lemon in half and squeeze in juice. Add reserved 1 Tbsp. anchovy mayo, remaining 3 Tbsp. mayo, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and whisk to combine, then stir in Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper. Set dressing aside.
Add bread to reserved skillet with fat and turn to coat. Return skillet to oven and toast bread, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and crisp, 12–15 minutes. Transfer croutons to bowl with reserved dressing. Add romaine and gently toss until lettuce is well coated. Season salad with salt and pepper.

Bring the water to a boil, then drain. Repeat this process two more times (blanching the orange zest removes any bitter flavors). Place the ginger and orange zest in a jar or heatproof container. In a saucepan, bring the lime juice, vinegar, sugar, and ¾ teaspoon salt to a boil. Pour over the ginger and orange. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate overnight. The pickled ginger can be refrigerated for a couple of months.
Drain the pickled ginger and orange and save 3 tablespoons of the pickling liquid. Add both to a blender or mini food processor, along with the olive oil, chile, and remaining 2 tablespoons salt. Blend until very smooth, scraping down the side of the blender as needed. Transfer to a container and refrigerate until ready to use. The puree can be made a couple of days ahead. (Makes about 1 cup.)
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the beets in a baking dish (if using a mix of red and golden beets, separate them into two smaller dishes and divide the oil, vinegar, and water between the two dishes). Drizzle with the oil and add the water and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and roast until the beets are tender when pierced with a knife; this can take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the beets. Let the beets cool, then peel and cut into 1-inch wedges. Place each color of beet, along with any accumulated juices, into a small mixing bowl.
In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the cashews and cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
Pour 1 inch of oil into a small saucepan and add the sunchokes (there should be just enough oil to cover the sunchokes; add more oil if needed). Turn the heat to medium and stir occasionally; when the sunchokes begin to sizzle and foam, increase the temperature to high and continue frying, stirring constantly, until the sunchokes are light golden brown. At this point the sunchokes will rapidly go from golden brown to burnt, so quickly transfer the chips to paper towels to drain. Lightly season with salt. The sunchoke chips can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two, or until they start to soften. (Makes about ½ cup.)
Using a sharp knife, cut the peel and pith off the orange. Working over a bowl, cut the orange between the membranes to release the segments. Dice the segments, then return them to the bowl.

Butter a 9-inch nonstick metal cake pan with some ghee.
In a large bowl, stir together the paneer, confectioners’ sugar, and cardamom until incorporated but still slightly chunky. Add the semolina, ghee, and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cashews and raisins and set aside.
Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and once the sugar just begins to bubble and turn pale golden brown (the sugar will continue to caramelize in the oven, so don’t let it get any darker right now), after 8 to 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat using tongs. (This step is a bit tricky and you might be tempted to move the sugar around with a spoon while it is bubbling, but don’t touch it—just let it caramelize on its own.) You will know it’s ready for the cake batter when it’s bubbling but is still slightly grainy and just turning a pale golden color. Pour the batter into the pan, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean. It should settle into an even layer on its own, but if it doesn’t, use the spatula to create a smooth surface.
Wearing oven mitts, carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cake’s edges and then place a serving platter larger than the diameter of the cake over the cake and gently flip the cake over—it should slide out, with caramel coming out with it like you would see in a flan (though some caramel will be left in the pan—this is fine).
Slice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

23,Paneer,"['2 quarts whole milk', 'Juice of 2 lemons', '½ teaspoon kosher salt']","In a medium saucepan, heat the milk to 195°F over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon, stir frequently during the heating process to prevent the milk from scalding. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan when you stir because this is where the milk is most prone to sticking. The milk will become foamy and bubbles will form on its surface once it reaches the desired temperature.
Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice until evenly distributed, which will cause the separation of curds from the whey. The process should begin right away, but don’t fret if it takes a minute or two. Cover the pan and set aside at room temperature for 10 minutes to let the acid work its magic. Check the mixture at this point: It should be slightly yellow and the curds should have completely separated from the whey. Don’t panic if this hasn’t happened completely yet. Simply add another teaspoon of acid and set aside for a few minutes more. This should do the trick.
Line a fine-mesh sieve with cheesecloth and set the sieve over a bowl. Ladle the curds and whey into the sieve. Reserve the whey for another use. Season the curds (still in the sieve) with salt, stirring it in using a wooden spoon, then gather up the edges of the cheesecloth into a tight bundle and squeeze the excess whey from the curds. Place the cheesecloth and curds on a large plate and shape them into a square. Wrap the cheesecloth edges around the paneer and place a second plate on top of it to compress it. Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Combine the carrot, tomatoes plus their juice, and 1 cup water in a blender. Blitz till it’s as smooth as your blender allows.
In an ovenproof 12-inch sauté pan or skillet set over medium heat, cook 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and the minced garlic. Watch for the garlic to start sizzling, then stir in the spinach and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Continue stirring for a minute, until all the spinach is wilted. Remove it from the pan and set aside.
Add the final tablespoon olive oil to the pan, raise the heat to medium, and add the turkey plus 1 teaspoon salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, break the turkey up into small morsels as it browns. When you have browned turkey, add the cumin, paprika, and black pepper. Stir to incorporate, toasting the spices for about 30 seconds.
Add the carrot-tomato mixture, the R-Rated Onions, vinegar, and ½ teaspoon salt. Let this cook for about 15 minutes, uncovered, stirring occasionally. You may need to lower the heat to prevent Joe from sticking or splattering. When the ragout is done it will be thick and juicy. If it seems too dry, stir in a little water. Taste the ragout for seasoning and adjust as you like.
Turn the heat off and make four indentions in the ragout. Divide the spinach and put equal amounts in each indentation. Top each section of spinach with a cracked egg. Sprinkle the eggs with the remaining 1 teaspoon salt.

25,R-Rated Onions,"['4–5 large or 6–8 medium yellow or white onions', '1 Tbsp olive or vegetable oil', '1 tsp kosher salt']","Peel your onions and cut them in half through their stem ends—longways, if you will. Slice them thinly with the grain, following the line from root to stem rather than cutting the onion across its belly. This is actually important because slicing it the other way makes the path to silky onions a longer one.
Once your onions are sliced, heat your skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil, then the onions and the salt. Let the onions sizzle for a couple minutes. Stir with a wooden spoon or a heatproof spatula and watch as they wilt for about 3 more minutes. At this point, reduce the heat to medium low. Put a lid on and step away for a few minutes. Give the onions a stir every now and then. You don’t have to stand over it like risotto, but don’t go for a walk around the block either. Caramelized bits will accumulate at the bottom and sides of the pan, and that’s good. Just scrape them up and stir them in. A little color building as you go is okay, but don’t rush to brown them. The point is to cook the onions gently, coaxing them through stages of raw, wilted, sweaty, soft, light brown, and finally deeply caramelized
About 45 minutes in, remove the lid for the last time. They should be a light caramel color. Now, with the lid off, you will need to watch more closely and stir more frequently. At some point you may find that despite your best efforts some of the caramelized bits, verging on burnt, cling to the pan and threaten over all onion ruin. Do not fret! Just add a ½ cup or so of water and use its energy to help scrape up the stubborn but tasty film. Let the water cook out of course.

Drain. Bring 3 fresh cups of water to a boil in a saucepan and add the peas. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until cooked almost completely through. Drain and set aside. If using canned beans, drain, rinse with cold water, drain again, and set aside.

Note: Pigeon peas are traditional in this dish, but pinto beans or black-eyes peas also work well because, like pigeon peas, they hold their shape well after cooking. Brown sugar is preferable for deeper flavor and color. Chicken is the most common meat in pelau, but cuts of stew beef or lamb work just as well. If using meat, up the cooking time before adding the rice to 40 minutes to allow the meat to get tender. In Tobago, pelau is often made with crab. West Indian pumpkin (also called calabaza) is ideal for this recipe, although the pie or ""cheese"" pumpkin common in the U.S., if in season, makes a very good substitute.

36,Creole Cream Cheesecake With Caramel-Apple Topping,"['2 cups graham cracker crumbs (about 16 whole crackers)', '3 tablespoons granulated sugar', '3 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar', '1⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt', '1⁄2 cup unsalted butter, melted', '2 pounds cream cheese, at room temperature', '1 cup granulated sugar', '1⅓ cups Creole Cream Cheese', '1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste', '2 eggs, at room temperature', 'Ingredient Info: You can substitute 1 cup sour cream mixed with 1⁄4 cup buttermilk for the 1⅓ cups Creole Cream Cheese.', '3¾ tablespoons unsalted butter', '3⁄4 cup granulated sugar', '1⁄4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar', '1½ tablespoons honey', '4 cups peeled, cored, and evenly chopped Granny Smith apples (about 7)', '1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest', '1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice', '3⁄4 teaspoon kosher salt', '3⁄4 teaspoon ground cinnamon', '1⁄3 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1⁄3 teaspoon ground ginger', '1 teaspoon vanilla extract']","Make the crust. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and butter to combine. Pat the mixture into a 10-inch springform pan, pressing the crumbs firmly in an even layer on the bottom and making sure they come at least halfway up the side of the pan. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, until the crust is fragrant, dry, and toasty. Let cool, then wrap the entire outside of the pan tightly in two layers of foil, all the way to the top.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a handheld mixer, cream the plain cream cheese and sugar on medium-high speed for about 4 minutes, until incredibly smooth and light. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the Creole Cream Cheese and vanilla paste and beat on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl once more. Decrease the speed to medium and beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each one before adding the next. Mix just until the batter is smooth and uniform. Continuing to mix past that point, even though the batter won’t look different, only incorporates extra air, which will cause the cheesecake to bubble excessively and the surface to crack as that air tries to escape during the baking process.
Decrease the oven temperature to 350°F. Pour the batter into the prepared crust and tap the pan gently on the counter a few times to remove any large air bubbles. Place the springform pan in a large baking or roasting pan (just big enough for the springform pan to fit in) and set the pan on the middle rack in the oven. Fill the pan with enough hot water to reach the rim of the springform pan. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the sides of the custard are set and the middle is still just slightly wobbly. Generally, if the entirety of the custard is fully set, your cheesecake is overbaked. Don’t panic—it’ll still be delicious, and you’ll do better next time!
Let the cheesecake cool in the water until it is about room temperature. (You don’t want to have to try to grab the pan out of hot water if you can help it.) However, if you’re worried that your cheesecake might be slightly overbaked, you’ll want to pull it out rather quickly, and let it cool at room temperature. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before slicing. The cake can be refrigerated, covered, for up to 4 days.
In a large heavy-bottomed sauté pan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and honey and let cook until bubbling. Add the apples and toss to coat. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger; stir to combine. Cook for about 4 minutes, or until the apples just start to soften.

Add about a fourth of ¾ cup warm water (110°) and mix in a wide circular motion with your fingers to gently combine (do not knead). As mixture becomes dry, add more of the water, little by little, and keep mixing gently until a shaggy dough forms; it should be soft and sticky, without dry spots. (Depending on the humidity, you may not need all of the water.)
Drizzle 1 Tbsp. oil over dough and gently press with your knuckles so that the top of dough is covered with oil. Cover bowl with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest in a warm spot 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix shortening and ghee in a small bowl until smooth.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and gently fold dough over on itself once or twice, then roll into a fat cylinder. Working quickly, without handling the dough too much, divide dough into four equal pieces and gently form each piece into a ball. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 10 minutes.
Roll out a dough ball on a lightly floured surface into a 5-6""–diameter round. Brush with a quarter of shortening mixture and sprinkle evenly with flour. Cut a slit halfway across the dough, from the center to the edge. Starting on one side of slit, fold cut edge of dough at about a ¾"" interval. Continue folding process until you reach the other side of the slit and have formed a cone. Pinch together edges at wide end of cone to seal, then bring both point ends together at the top and gently push in toward center of cone to create a dimple (you don’t need to push in too far). Push point at narrow end of cone in toward the center. You should now have a ball with a dimple on each end. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and repeat with remaining balls of dough. Cover balls with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rest 20 minutes.
Heat a tawa or griddle over medium until a drop of water immediately sizzles on surface, about 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, place a ball of dough on a dimpled side on a lightly floured surface. Gently flatten into a round with your hands, turning once if desired, then roll, rotating often, to a ⅛""-thick round, about 10–12"".
Brush tawa with a thin layer of oil. Cook roti until it begins to bubble slightly across the surface, about 20 seconds. Brush surface of roti with oil and continue to cook until bubbles across surface increase and roti is stiff enough on bottom side to turn, about 1 minute more. Turn roti over and brush surface with oil (bubbles may deflate; that’s okay). Using a spatula, move roti around to avoid hot spots and ensure even cooking, pressing on edges and uncooked spots to increase contact with pan. Continue to cook, turning every 30 seconds or so, until cooked through and both sides are speckled with golden brown spots, 1–2 minutes more. Using 2 spatulas, push opposite edges of roti toward the center. Smack down on the bunched roti with the ends of the spatulas to break up and flake, then turn roti over.

Add ¼ cup of the pumpkin purée, then 1 cup milk, and then 1 Tbsp. of the butter, blending for 30 seconds after each addition. Add 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp. allspice, ¼ tsp. ground ginger, ¼ tsp. nutmeg, ½ tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. of the cinnamon in one addition. Blend again until combined and frothy, 1 minute (scraping down the sides of the blender if necessary).
Pull the hot pan from the oven and add the remaining 2 Tbsp. butter, swirling the pan so it melts evenly across the bottom (it will bubble and brown). Once the butter is melted, immediately pour in the Dutch baby batter and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown and slightly puffed, 20 minutes.
While the Dutch baby bakes, combine ½ cup apple cider, 3 Tbsp. maple syrup, the remaining ½ tsp. cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and the rest of the can of pumpkin purée (about 1 ¼ cups) in a small saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture starts to bubble, then reduce to medium and cook, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides of the pot with a spatula, until dark and thickened with no raw pumpkin flavor remaining, 20 to 25 minutes.

43,Braised Chicken Legs With Grapes and Fennel,"['4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3½ lb.), patted dry', '4½ tsp. kosher salt, divided', '2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided', '2 medium fennel bulbs (about 1 lb.), plus ¼ cup coarsely chopped fronds', '1 lb. Red Flame or green table grapes, stems removed (about 2 cups)', '1 cup unsalted chicken broth', '¼ cup honey', '4 tsp. Calabrian chile paste or chopped Calabrian chiles', '1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar']","Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°F. Season chicken legs all over with 3 tsp. salt.
Swirl 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to coat and heat over medium-high. Place 2 chicken legs, skin side down, in pot, making sure skin is in direct contact with pan. Cook, undisturbed, until dark golden, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken legs; reserve pot.
Meanwhile, working one at a time, stand a bulb, root end down, on a cutting board and slice off a short end to create a flat surface. Turn cut side down and slice ½"" thick, starting from the top end of bulb so the root end can hold the layers in place while you slice. Discard last ¼"" (root end) of each bulb and pop out and discard tougher center from slices. Transfer fennel to a large bowl and add half of the grapes, ½ tsp. salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; toss to coat. Set aside.
Reduce heat to medium and combine broth, honey, chile paste, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in reserved pot. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. Place remaining grapes in pot and arrange chicken legs, skin side up and overlapping if needed, over grapes. Top with dressed fennel and grapes. (Don’t worry if it looks crowded: Fennel will soften as it cooks.)
Transfer pot, uncovered, to oven and roast until fennel is slightly softened, with some crispy, caramelized edges, grapes on top are swollen and browned in spots, and chicken is cooked through, 30–40 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer grapes and fennel to a bowl and chicken to a platter. Place pot over medium-high heat and bring braising liquid to a simmer.

46,Pita,"['1½ cups warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast', '4½ cups (540 grams) bread flour, divided, plus more as needed', '2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for your bowl', '3½ teaspoons Morton kosher salt']","Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl (if you have a stand mixer, use that bowl) and let sit for 5 minutes.
Reserve ½ cup (60 grams) bread flour and add the remaining 4 cups to the mixing bowl along with the canola oil.
If you have a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook and knead the mixture on low speed for about 3 minutes, until a sticky but cohesive dough starts to form. Pause occasionally to scrape down the bowl if the flour is clinging to the sides and bottom or climbing up the hook. If you’re making the dough without a stand mixer, mix it with a wooden spoon. In either case, loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
With your stand mixer on low or while stirring by hand in the mixing bowl, add the salt and, over the course of 2 or 3 minutes, add the remaining ½ cup flour, 2 tablespoons at a time. The dough should be more tense; it will feel soft but tacky, although it will pull from the sides of the bowl.
Flour your hands generously and use them to pull the dough onto a clean, unfloured work surface. Cup your hands around the dough, rolling it in short, circular strokes and using the sides of your hands to nudge it into a relatively smooth ball.
Lightly wipe the inside of a large bowl with canola oil and place the dough inside, flipping it once or twice to coat. Loosely cover the bowl and let the dough rise at a warm room temperature for 1 hour.
After 1 hour, the dough will be stretchy but very soft. Leaving it inside the bowl, stretch opposite sides of the dough over the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter- turn and stretch the dough in the same way, then flip the whole mound of dough upside down and cover again. Let rise for 1 hour.
Repeat this series of folds one more time, allow it to rise at room temperature for 1 hour, then tightly cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days. The longer the dough is refrigerated, the more flavor it will have. After this rise, it’s ready to be shaped; bear in mind that, once it’s shaped, it will need more time for a final rise, so plan ahead.
Wipe a bit of canola oil on a large baking sheet. Dump the dough onto a clean, dry counter, and use a bench scraper or sharp knife to cut it into eight equal pieces; make clean, decisive cuts rather than use a sawing motion, so you don’t deflate all the air inside.
Lightly flour your hands and place one palm directly over the dough ball, with all your fingertips touching the counter to make a sort of “cage” around the dough. Roll it in brisk, small circles on the countertop so it tightens itself into a smoother, more taut ball.
Space the rounds of dough a few inches apart, seam side down, on the sheet, and roll to coat them lightly in oil. Tightly cover the sheet with plastic wrap so the dough doesn’t dry out, and let them rise at room temperature for 2 to 4 more hours, until they’re pillowy.
Meanwhile, set a baking stone on the center rack of your oven and turn on the broiler. You’re emulating a 700°F wood- burning oven, so you need to give the stone a good long while to preheat before you bake.
When the dough is ready, lightly flour a work surface, and use a bench scraper or thin metal spatula to coax one piece into your palm; be sure you don’t manhandle it or you’ll force out the pockets of air that formed while it rose. Dust a little more flour on the top of the dough and onto your rolling pin.
With firm, even pressure, briskly roll the dough a few times along its length. Flip it upside down, rotate it a quarter- turn, and roll it the same way, keeping it as round as possible. Repeat, dusting a little extra flour as needed, until it’s about 6 inches across.
This next part happens fast and furiously, so make sure you have no distractions—screaming children and natural disasters will have to wait. Use tongs or a good oven mitt to pull the oven rack with the baking stone partially out. Carefully pick up the pita, drape it over your palm, and slap it down onto the stone as if you’re giving it a high- five (just be careful not to touch the hot stone!). Set a timer for 1 minute, and close the oven. Broilers vary in strength but all are quite hot, so don’t turn your back on the oven or the pita may burn. Check on it— it should puff up and build in color, with some beautiful blistered spots. If it’s still pale, close the oven and let it keep baking for 30- second intervals.
Use tongs to flip the pita, and let it finish baking with the oven door cracked so you can watch it finish. Pull it out when the second side is as pretty as the first; this can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your broiler.
Bake off the rest of the dough this way; as you get the hang of it, feel free to bake two pitas at a time. Serve these hot or at room temperature.",fresh-homemade-pita-alon-shaya,"['1½ cups warm water', '1 teaspoon instant yeast', '4½ cups (540 grams) bread flour, divided, plus more as needed', '2 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for your bowl', '3½ teaspoons Morton kosher salt']"

Place the chopped beets in a large stockpot. Add 10 cups of water and 1 tablespoon vinegar.
Place the stockpot over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. (If it seems like the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you may need to cover the pot partially with an offset lid.) The beets should be extremely soft and the liquid bright red.
Strain the liquid, pressing the cooked beets against the side of the strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard the pulp or reserve. Set aside the beet water. You should have just about 4 cups.
Meanwhile, place the remaining 1 pound of whole beets in a separate large stockpot. Add water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the beets are tender-firm, about 40 minutes. When the beets are cooked, add 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set them aside to cool.
When the whole cooked beets are cool enough to handle, peel them; the skins should slip off easily. Grate the peeled beets on the largest holes of a box grater or in a food processor fitted with the grating blade.
To make the broth, place the pork butt in a large stockpot and add the beef stock. If necessary, add a little more stock or water to cover. Add the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the meat is tender and beginning to fall apart, about 2 hours. Set the pork aside to cool. When the pork is cool enough to handle, remove it from the pot and cut the meat into ½-inch cubes. Strain the broth and discard the bay leaf, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Reserve the cubed meat and 4 cups of the broth.
To cook the vegetables, place the carrots and celery in a large stockpot and pour the reserved meat broth over them. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the carrots and celery are just tender, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage and potatoes and continue to cook until the potatoes and carrots are easily pierced with a pairing knife but keep their shape, 15 to 20 additional minutes. Add the lima beans and cook for 5 additional minutes, just to meld the flavors. Gradually add the remaining 7 tablespoons white vinegar, tasting between additions and stopping when the flavor is to your liking. Remove the soup from the heat and set aside.

Drain the beans and kombu and add them to a large pot with enough water to cover by about 1 in. (if using fresh beans, add the kombu now). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; meanwhile, halve the tomatoes and cut the celery, carrot, and leek into about 3 in. pieces. As soon as the water boils, decrease the heat to medium-low and add the vegetables to the pot, along with the whole shallots and minced garlic. Continue to cook at a gentle simmer until the beans are very creamy, 60 to 90 minutes for dried beans and about half that for fresh.
Remove the pot from the heat and use a slotted spoon to reserve the tomatoes; remove and discard the other vegetables.
Set up a sieve over a heat proof container and strain the beans (there should be about 3 cups or 480 g), reserving all the cooking liquid.
In a blender, combine 1 cup (160 g) of the cooked beans with 2 cups (480 ml) of the cooking liquid, plus the tomatoes, anchovies, oil, maple syrup, salt, red pepper flakes, and mustard. Purée until extremely smooth, pour into a large bowl, and fold in the reserved cooked beans by hand. At this point, you can serve it right away or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days, gently rewarming over medium-low heat when you’re ready to serve.
While the bean soup is cooking, preheat the oven to 325°F. Cut the bacon into ¼ in. lardons; reserve 3 whole beans for garnish and cut the rest into 2 to 3 in. pieces.
In a medium saucepan or Dutch oven, spread the bacon in an even layer and cook over medium-low heat until it starts to turn golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the pieces but leave the fat behind.
Increase the heat slightly, and sauté the shallots until translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in the chopped beans, bacon, and red pepper flakes. Cover with a lid or a tight layer of foil and bake until the beans are very soft, 60 to 90 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, juice, and garlic as soon as the beans come out of the oven and cover again; the residual steam will cook the garlic.
Thinly slice the pickled green beans on the bias. Combine with the cherry tomatoes, oil, and vinegar.
To serve, ladle the bean soup into bowls with a big spoonful of the baked beans on top. Garnish with the pickled green bean mix, a swirl of tomato brown butter, crumbled feta, and torn fresh herbs. Leftovers can all be refrigerated in separate airtight containers, though the green bean salad is best on the day it’s made, when the beans are most crisp and the tomatoes are fresh.
This works for any amount of dense vegetables or dense, underripe fruit, either whole or cut up, such as carrots, turnips, beets, winter squash, onions, green beans, Brussels sprouts, green tomatoes, small apples, underripe peaches, and whole baby cabbages. Peel off any tough skins, such as on beets, winter squash, and onions, and trim the tops. Leave the vegetables whole or cut them into the desired finished shape. Place the vegetables in a nonreactive container and pour water to completely submerge them; as you do so, keep track of how much water you’re adding since the amount of water will dictate the amount of salt (generally 3.5 percent salt by weight of the water for most vegetables, although cucumbers can handle 4 to 5 percent and the increased salt assists with keeping their texture crispy). With a long wooden spoon, stir kosher salt into the brine (or add the salt, cap the jar, and give it a hearty shake) until the salt is dissolved. Place a weight on top of the vegetables to keep them submerged in the brine. Seal the container, using a lid with an airlock if you have one. If you don’t have an airlock, you’ll just need to open the container every few days or so to release carbon dioxide buildup and check for mold. Place the container in a clean, low-light area with an ambient temperature of 60°F to 68°F until the pickles taste sour, about 3 weeks.

Working one at a time, set potatoes on a flat surface and crush slightly with the palm of your hand. Add to bowl with dressing along with ¼ cup potato cooking liquid. Do this while the potatoes are still warm so that they can absorb all of the seasoning. Don't worry if the dressing looks a little loose and watery at the beginning—it will all get absorbed and become creamier as it sits.

Lightly butter the inside of a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan.
Make the crust: Crumble the crackers and cookies into a medium bowl. Use a pestle or the bottom of a heavy bottle to crush them into fine crumbs. Add ⅓ cup (75 ml) of the condensed milk and stir until very well combined. (You can grind the crumbled graham crackers and mix them with the condensed milk in a food processor if you prefer.) Press the crumb mixture firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. Bake until the crust looks a little darker and smells sweet and toasty, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool the crust in the pan on a wire rack.
One at a time, cut an avocado in half lengthwise. Twist the halves to separate them. Hold the half with the pit in one hand. Holding the knife in your other hand, rap the knife blade into the pit to lodge it there. Twist the knife to loosen and remove the pit. Use a large spoon to scoop the avocado flesh onto a chopping board, discarding the skins. Coarsely chop the avocados.
Add the chopped avocados, cream cheese, remaining condensed milk, and salt to a food processor. (You can combine the filling in a blender instead but you may need to work in batches.) Grate the zest of 1 lemon and set aside. Squeeze the zested lemon and the limes (you should have about ⅓ cup/75 ml lemon), reserving the remaining lemon for garnish. Add the juice to the avocados and process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
Spread the filling in the cooled crust and sprinkle with the grated lemon zest. Cover the pan and freeze until the filling is firm, at least 6 hours or preferably overnight.

Toast them slowly, shaking the pan often, until lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove them from the skillet, and when they are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the nuts.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid and add it to a large bowl.
In a large skillet, heat the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter begins to foam, add the garlic and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until the butter begins to brown and have a slight nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Add the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Give the mixture a good stir, and then set it aside to infuse for about 5 minutes longer away from the heat.
Pour the butter mixture (scraping the garlic, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes) all over the warm pasta. If the pasta feels a bit dry, add a touch of the reserved cooking liquid. Toss to combine and set aside.
Set the same skillet (without cleaning it) over medium-high heat. Add the chard stems and cook for 5 minutes. Add the chard leaves and continue to cook, tossing the mixture every so often, until the greens begin to wilt and turn bright green, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Add a touch more butter or oil to the pan if it dries out too much.
Add the Swiss chard and hazelnuts to the pasta and toss it all together. Add the Parmesan shavings and the balsamic vinegar (if you’re using it); toss. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper if needed.

In a large, wide bowl, combine the flour, salt, and parsley. Add the butter pieces and, using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut them up and into the flour mixture until it resembles little pebbles. Keep breaking up the bits of butter until the texture is very coarse.
In a small dish, whisk together the sour cream, vinegar, and water, and combine it with the butter-flour mixture. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, stir the wet and the dry together until a shaggy dough forms. If needed, get your hands into the bowl to knead it a few times into one big ball. Pat the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill it in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 2 days.

Sprinkle a little flour in the bottom of a 10-inch well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Set it aside.
On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 13-inch circle. Fit it into the prepared skillet, allowing the edges to extend over the sides of the pan.
Spread the cheese mixture evenly over the bottom of the dough. Arrange the tomatoes on top. Gently fold the overhanging pie crust over the tomatoes. It doesn’t have to be perfect.
Drizzle the pie with the remaining 1 tablespoon cooking fat and season with pepper. In a small bowl, whisk together the beaten egg and milk. Brush the crust with this egg wash, place the cast-iron pan on a rimmed baking sheet (to protect the bottom of your oven from any overflowing filling), and bake the pie until the tomatoes are browned, 50 to 60 minutes.

Heat 2 inches vegetable oil in a large, deep pan or wok over medium-high heat until it reaches about 340°F, 8 to 10 minutes. If you don’t have a thermometer, test it by dipping a tip of a chicken piece into the oil. If it bubbles, it’s ready. Carefully add the chicken to the oil one piece at a time, working in batches to avoid overcrowding.
Deep-fry, turning the chicken with tongs, until all sides are light golden brown and crunchy, 10 to 12 minutes. As each piece is done, transfer it to the strainer. Once the chicken has drained, transfer it to a large bowl. Repeat with the rest of the chicken, making sure to bring the oil back up to 340°F between batches.
Return the oil to 340°F over high heat and carefully add all the chicken—there’s no need to work in batches this time. The chicken will look a little soggy at first. Deep-fry, turning occasionally, until all the chicken pieces are dark golden brown and very crunchy, another 10 to 13 minutes. Transfer the chicken pieces to the strainer or a rack to drain, then place in a large bowl.

Add the pork and turn to coat the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
The next day, set a large sauté pan over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the pork, working in batches so as not to overcrowd the pan and leaving any liquid in the bowl. Cook, stirring occasionally and flipping the meat, until lightly caramelized and golden brown on both sides, about 10 minutes. (If you overcrowd the pan, the meat will steam instead of sear.) Transfer to a platter.
When the meat is cooked, open the buns, butter the interiors, and toast them until they are a light golden brown.
To serve, spread both cut sides of each bun with a healthy smear of mayo and pile the spicy pork generously on the bottoms of the buns. Top with the sliced cucumbers. Serve immediately.
The pork belly must be marinated overnight. You can also grill the pork on an outdoor grill over a high flame.

Brush one fourth of basting liquid over skin and turn chicken over, positioning over direct heat on the hot side of the grill. Grill, brushing half of remaining basting liquid over bone side of chicken, until skin is browned and lightly charred in spots, about 3 minutes. (Watch carefully as this can happen quickly.) Turn chicken over and return to cooler side of grill. Brush skin with remaining basting liquid. Cover grill and continue to grill chicken until thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160° and thickest part of thighs registers 165°, 10–15 minutes longer.

Add the broccoli florets and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the broccoli to a large bowl.
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook for 1 minute less than the package instructions for al dente, about 9 minutes.

Remove the lid, set the pot over high heat, and heat until the surface of the water begins to ripple; pay attention, and do not let it come to a boil. Lower the heat to maintain a very gentle simmer (the ideal temperature is a few degrees below a light boil) and simmer for 80 to 90 minutes. Taste the dashi every 20 minutes to monitor the changes in flavor and texture. You will notice the texture becoming softer. I describe it as having a slippery, slightly viscous texture compared to tap water. The sea flavor will become stronger, and the dashi will become darker, like pale Earl Grey tea. The sweetness will take a while to appear, but when it does, the dashi is almost ready. When you can taste the sweetness and deep sea flavors, and the dashi has a very soft texture, it is done. Be vigilant, because dashi will become bitter if cooked too long.
Strain the dashi into a covered container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. After 24 hours, the dashi will begin to lose some of its flavor and it will turn slightly flat.
It’s best to use dashi the same day you make it, though if you keep it refrigerated, you can use it for another day or two. By the third day, it will no longer taste fresh.

Put the tamarind pulp in a heat-proof nonreactive bowl, and cover with the boiling water. Cover and let sit for about 1 hour, until the pulp has become soft and mushy. Using a small potato masher or clean hands, massage and squeeze the block to soften the pulp. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer suspended over a medium bowl, pressing the pulp through the strainer with a large spoon. Discard the seeds and other solids left behind. Refrigerate the tamarind extract in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, for up to 4 days.
Rinse the ginger and gently scrub to remove any traces of dirt. If the ginger is young, with a thin skin, leave the skin on. Otherwise, peel. Cut into thin slices. In a medium saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, and remaining 1 cup (240 ml) water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and immediately remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover and steep for 10 minutes. Strain the ginger simple syrup through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the ginger.

Store any remaining tamarind-ginger syrup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
This rejuvenating drink combines the mild heat of young ginger and the sourness of tamarind. It’s wonderful during the warmer months.

Sumac is rich in citric, malic, and tartaric acids but also bitter tannins. Steeping it in water dissolves the water-soluble acids. Gallotannin, one of the main tannins present in sumac, is bitter to taste and dissolves in water easily. Avoid steeping the sumac for too long or its tannins will make the syrup bitter. Saffron is ground to a fine powder using a little sugar as an abrasive. Grinding saffron increases the amount of color and flavor extracted than would be achieved if the strands were used directly. Club soda if used, adds a second note of acidity from the carbonic acid as well as the crackling sound of bubbles that create a sensation via chemesthesis.",sumac-and-saffron-refresher-nik-sharma,"['15 to 20 saffron strands, plus a few extra strands for garnish', '½ cup (100 g) sugar', '3 green cardamom pods, smashed', '¼ cup (30 g) ground sumac', '3 cups (700 ml) chilled club soda or water']"

Place crackers in a deep pie dish (a shallower one will work but you may have some filling left over) and gently crush with your hands until you have a mix of dime-size pieces, small crumbs, and everything in between. Add peanuts, brown sugar, and salt and toss to combine. Drizzle in butter and toss to evenly coat. Using your hands and the bottom of a measuring cup, press firmly and evenly into bottom and up sides of dish. (Mixture will look and feel crumbly, but it will hold together when baked.) Bake crust until a shade darker, 20–25 minutes. Let cool.
Do Ahead: Crust can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature, or freeze up to 1 month.
Pour water into a medium saucepan to come 1½"" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you’ve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes. (Or, if using a stand mixer, beat with the whisk attachment, 6–8 minutes.)
Using spatula, mix peanut butter in another large bowl to loosen up and smooth out. Stir one third of egg mixture into peanut butter to lighten, then gently fold in half of remaining egg mixture, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl, until just combined. Repeat with remaining egg mixture (it will lose a lot of volume, and that’s okay).
Starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high, beat cream in the same bowl you used for egg mixture (no need to wash) until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gently fold into peanut butter mixture and scrape into crust. Dollop jelly all over; swirl with a butter knife. (For more defined swirls, freeze pie 30 minutes before adding jelly.) Freeze at least 8 hours before serving.
To slice, run a chef’s knife under hot water to warm up the blade, then wipe to clean and dry between slices. Use an offset spatula or fork to loosen slices from dish. If pie is frozen very hard, you may need to let it temper in the fridge 30 minutes before serving.

Add the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until soft and caramelized. Add the rest of the sauce ingredients, along with 2½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Simmer over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, then remove from the heat and set aside.
To make the stuffing, while the sauce is cooking, place all the ingredients in a large bowl with 1½ tsp of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well, using your hands to make sure that everything is well incorporated. If making in advance, keep in the fridge until ready to use.
Trim the stalks from the eggplants, then insert a manakra (or peeler or corer) into the eggplant; you want it to be very close to the skin—about ⅛ inch/3mm away—but not so close that it tears and won’t hold its shape when it’s stuffed. Scoop out the flesh to create a generous cavity. You don’t need the flesh anymore, but keep it for another recipe; it can be cut into cubes and steamed or added to your next omelette. If your eggplants are particularly large, slice them in half, crosswise, and scoop out the flesh using a regular small serrated knife—be sure to keep one end of each half intact, so that the stuffing does not fall out!
Use the manakra or a swivel peeler to scoop out the zucchini flesh. Keep about ⅛ inch/3mm of flesh attached to the skin inside the zucchini and about ½ inch/1cm from the end intact—they need to be robust enough to keep the stuffing inside. Again, keep the scooped-out flesh to use elsewhere.
Using your hands, so that you can push in a bit of stuffing at a time, fill all the eggplant and zucchini cavities. Stop filling them about ½ inch/1cm from the top of each vegetable; the stuffing needs some space to expand inside the vegetables when they are cooking.
Gently lower the stuffed vegetables into the sauce. They won’t fit in a single layer, but try to avoid too much overlap and submerge them in the sauce as much as you can. Return the sauce to medium heat and, once simmering, decrease the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer very gently for 90 minutes, or until the rice is completely cooked through and soft—test if it is ready by sticking a knife into the middle of one of the vegetables; it should go in very easily. Don’t worry if some of the rice/stuffing spills into the tomato sauce, this can happen and it will be fine when served.
To make the adha, meanwhile, put the oil into a small frying pan and place over medium heat. After about 1 minute, add the garlic and decrease the heat to medium-low. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring very often, until the garlic is golden and crispy. Keep a close eye on the pan here; you don’t want the oil to get too hot and for the garlic to burn. Reserving the oil as you pour, strain the garlic through a sieve. Set the garlic aside—it will crisp up as it cools down—and return the oil to the pan. Add the coriander seeds and chile and cook for about 1 minute, stirring a few times, until fragrant. Remove from the heat, transfer to a separate bowl, and set aside until needed.
When the vegetables are cooked and the sauce is thick and rich (but still pourable), use a slotted spoon to carefully lift the vegetables out of the pan. Pour the sauce onto a large serving platter (or individual serving plates) with a rim and top with the stuffed vegetables. Spoon on the adha—the coriander-chile oil first, followed by the fried garlic—then sprinkle with the fresh herbs and green onion.

To make the cake, combine the egg yolks, cassava, macapuno (or shredded coconut, if using), coconut milk and the ½ cup sweetened condensed milk in a large bowl and mix well.
Pour the cake batter into a greased 8 x 8-in (20 x 20-cm) cake pan. The cake batter will appear to be very loose and wet at this point, but don’t worry, the cassava will absorb most of the liquid during baking. Place the cake pan into the oven and bake until the top of the cake appears dry and no liquid is floating on the surface, 45–60 minutes.
Meanwhile, to make the topping, whisk together the egg whites and the ¼ cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk in a medium bowl until very well incorporated. Although you are using egg whites, don’t be concerned with making a foam or a meringue, just mix until combined.
Remove the cake from the oven and evenly pour the topping onto the cake. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the topping sets, about 10 minutes more.

Put the peaches in a 9-by-13-inch (or similar) baking pan or gratin dish. Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top.
In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1½ cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Plop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so it’s no more than about ½ inch thick in any one place.
Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. It’s a strange method, but it works.)
Bake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dry—be sure to check in a few places.)

Add the club soda, egg yolk, and garlic and mix gently using a whisk. Do not whisk too much, or extra gluten will form in the batter, making it too thick and doughy. Whisk about 10 times, then let the batter rest for 10 minutes in the freezer so any remaining small clumps of flour can dissolve and blend into the mixture by themselves.
When you’re ready to make the pancakes, line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside. Fold the scallions into the cold batter.
Set a 10-inch nonstick sauté pan over high heat and add about 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer and just barely smoke, add 1 cup of the scallion batter to the center of the pan. Using a spatula, spread it out to form a 7-inch pancake. (You don’t want the pancake to touch the sides of the pan, or the edges may burn before the center is cooked through.) Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the bottom of the pancake has set. Once it has set, gently slide your spatula under the edges of the pancake and lift them, tilting the pan, so some of the hot oil runs underneath the pancake. Then cook for 2 to 3 minutes more, until the bottom is a deep golden brown and crisp. You can check the color by gently lifting an edge of the pancake with your spatula. Flip the pancake and cook on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until it is golden brown on the second side and cooked through. Transfer to the prepared sheet pan to drain. Wipe out the pan, set it back over high heat, add another tablespoon or so of oil, and repeat until all of the pancakes are cooked. The finished pancakes can be kept in a low (200°F) oven on a clean sheet pan while you cook the remaining batches, but it’s best to eat them right away.
Cut each pancake into quarters and serve with small bowls of the Pajeon Sauce and ice-cold makgeolli (Korean rice wine).",scallion-pancakes-pajeon,"['2 cups all-purpose flour', '½ cup cornstarch', '2 teaspoons baking powder', '2 teaspoons sugar', '1 teaspoon doenjang (Korean fermentedsoybean paste)', '½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '2 cups ice-cold club soda', '1 medium egg yolk', '2 teaspoons minced garlic', '3 bunches scallions, cut into 2-inch batons (if the scallions are thick, cut the white parts lengthwise in half before cutting into batons)', 'About 5 tablespoons grape seed or canola oil, for frying', 'Pajeon Sauce']"

Flash steam firm vegetables like cauliflower and carrots in a colander over boiling water for just a minute or two: the pieces should still be firm. Lay them on a kitchen towel to dry. If using fresh turmeric, cover the chopping board in plastic wrap, and wear gloves. Scrape off the skin with a spoon as you would for ginger and rinse it clean to wash away any tough bits. Pat each fingerling down and slice into thin rounds or to match the ginger, and place on a paper towel to air dry. All vegetables must be dry to touch before pickling. To prepare ginger, peel and slice ginger into eighth-inch-thick slices, and chop them to look like carrot sticks. Spread on a paper towel and set aside to air dry for 15-20 minutes.
If using whole mustard seeds or whole fenugreek seeds, in two separate sets, crush each in a spice mill in short bursts until they each are broken down but not powdered. They should be the consistency of coffee grounds.
Method: Heat the oil in a large, wide mouth saucepan until it is hot but not smoking. Reduce the heat to low. Slowly add all the spices: mustard halves, fenugreek halves, asafetida powder, cayenne pepper if using, along with the serrano pepper if using, and ginger sticks. Add vinegar and salt. Allow this to sizzle for a minute on low. Stir to allow the heat to distribute evenly. When the oil is aromatic, slowly add the trimmed vegetables and stir in well. Turn up the heat and let this cook for 4-5 minutes until vegetables appear to have absorbed the spices a little. Turn off the heat and cover with a paper towel to capture any steam. Allow this to come to room temperature before storing.
To Store: Use smaller (4 – 6 oz.) sanitized and dried glass jars to store the pickle. Using a clean and dry spoon that is smaller than the mouth of the jar, ladle out portions of the pickle into each jar. Don’t worry if you don’t get the oils or juices when first filling the jars. Fill jars at least a half inch below the rim of the jar. Shake them once to allow the pieces to settle. Divide up any of the liquid over each of these jars, taking care that each jar has some of the spicy sauce. Lightly shake each jar to ensure the liquid finds its way into the nooks and crannies of vegetable pieces. Close the lid and store in the fridge. The pickle is ready to eat immediately after it is made, but the flavors are pronounced after a day or two.

Transfer to a large bowl and cover with 4 cups cold water. If your tap water is heavily chlorinated, use filtered water for soaking as chlorine will inhibit fermentation later on.
Pick over dal for debris, then rinse in sieve under cold running water. Transfer to a medium bowl and add fenugreek. Cover with 2 cups cold water (again using filtered if needed). Let rice and dal soak at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours.
Drain rice, holding back grains with your hand and pouring off most of the soaking liquid into a pitcher or large measuring glass. Transfer rice to a blender. Pulse to get things going, then purée, sparingly adding soaking liquid as needed, until a paste forms (mixture should be foamy and still slightly gritty when rubbed between your fingers). Pour into a clean large bowl. Repeat process with dal mixture, then vigorously stir blended dal into rice paste.
Add reserved soaking liquid as needed to create a pourable batter that falls off the spoon in a steady stream and gradually dissolves into itself. Stir in salt. (If you are in a warm climate, add salt after fermentation to keep batter from becoming overly sour.) Cover bowl with a kitchen towel, then a silicone lid (this will keep the surface of the batter from drying out). Set bowl in a warm spot (a proofing box or an oven with the light on and a bowl of hot water placed inside work well). Let batter sit until airy and pleasantly sour (when you drizzle it from a spoon, it should fall on itself in slowly dissolving ribbons), 4–6 hours in a very warm environment and as long as 2 days in a very cool environment. In general, 14 hours is a safe starting point.
Do ahead: Batter can be made 1 week ahead. Once fermented, cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before cooking. Thin with water if needed to reach a thick but pourable consistency.
Heat 2 tsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add green chiles and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Reduce heat to low, add tomatoes and any juices and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes are tender, 7–9 minutes. Carefully transfer to clean blender or a food processor and blend until smooth; reserve skillet. Taste chutney and season with more salt if needed. Transfer to a small bowl.
Wipe out reserved skillet and heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Cook mustard seeds, stirring constantly, until they start to pop, about 30 seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, and dal and cook, stirring occasionally, until curry leaves wilt and crisp and dal is starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Mix in asafoetida, if using, and remove spice oil from heat. Mix into chutney.
To cook dosas, heat a griddle or large skillet (the larger the better; you want the batter to have room to spread) over medium. Sprinkle a little water on surface; if it sizzles you’re good to go. (It’s important though not to let griddle get hotter than medium. If it’s too hot, the batter will start to cook before it’s fully spread out, yielding a thick dosa, or worse, a thin dosa that tears. Adjust heat as needed). Brush griddle with a thin layer of ghee, wiping off excess with a folded paper towel. Ladle a generous ⅓-cupful of batter in the center of griddle and use ladle to spread batter, working outward in continuous circles and never lifting ladle off surface, to create an 8""-diameter round. Ridges of thick and thin batter will form naturally. Cook dosa 30 seconds, then drizzle ⅛ tsp. ghee over batter. For a spongier dosa, cover with a large bowl and steam until cooked through, about 2 minutes (cooked underside should show through thinner spots, and thicker spots should be opaque and bouncy). For a drier dosa, cook until surface is mostly set, about 2 minutes, then, using a fish spatula or other wide spatula, flip dosa over (it should easily lift from the griddle at this point) and cook until second side is lightly golden, about 20 seconds. Fold dosa in half so toasted side is facing out and transfer to a plate. Repeat process with remaining batter and ghee.

Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Set aside for serving.
Blend garlic, dill, mint, tahini, and ⅓ cup water in a blender or food processor until a thick paste forms. Add lemon juice and blend again, adding an additional 1–2 Tbsp. water if sauce is too thick. It should be easily spreadable but not runny. Season with salt and lots of pepper.
Remove outer leaves and trim stem from cauliflower so it sits flat. Cut cauliflower into 4 wedges.
Whisk oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and a big pinch of salt in a large bowl to combine. Add cauliflower and coat in oil. The cauliflower can fall apart easily, so handle with care and use your fingers to work oil into the uneven surface.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat (if using a charcoal grill, bank most of the coals on one side of the grill). Place cauliflower, cut side down, on grate over hottest part of grill and grill, undisturbed, until char marks form, about 3 minutes (you can carefully lift to check, but try not to move too much). Turn over onto other cut side and grill, undisturbed, until grill marks form, about 3 minutes. Turn onto uneven floret side and slide over to cooler part of grill or reduce heat to low and cover with lid. Grill until tender (if a bamboo skewer easily slides through the thickest part, it’s done), 10–15 minutes. (And if you don’t have a grill, you can do this in a grill pan over high. Once pan is very hot, add cauliflower, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook both cut sides as above. When you turn cauliflower over onto uneven floret side, reduce heat to low and cover pan with foil to finish cooking.)

Toss shallots, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a small bowl to combine; lightly season with salt (the Pecorino will add some saltiness, so bear that in mind). Let sit 3 minutes.
Meanwhile, very thinly slice Pecorino into tiles with a knife (irregular pieces are okay).
Add Pecorino, herbs, and oil to pickled shallots and toss gently to combine. Taste and season with more salt if needed; set aside.
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; clean grate. Working one at a time, set mushrooms on their sides and slice lengthwise ¼"" thick to make 3–4 planks per mushroom, depending their size. If your mushrooms are particularly small or you are using crimini, slice ½"" thick and thread onto skewers to keep them from falling through grate.
Using some of the oil, brush cut sides of mushrooms and transfer to a large bowl or arrange on a rimmed baking sheet if skewered. Lightly brush both sides of each slice of bread with remaining oil and transfer to a platter.
Press each slice of bread down across grate for even contact and grill until browned with some lightly charred spots, about 2 minutes per side. The goal is a crunchy exterior with a still chewy center. Transfer bread back to platter.
Brush grate to clean. If using a gas grill, turn heat down to medium. A charcoal grill should be at the tail end of medium-high and headed toward medium at this point, but wait a few minutes if needed. Grill mushrooms, turning halfway through and moving around as needed to avoid flare-ups, until golden all over with lightly charred edges, 6–8 minutes for small pieces and 8–10 minutes for large ones.

Set aside.
With a small, sharp knife, release the edge of the membrane on the back of each rack of ribs. Grasp the edge with needle-nose pliers or a piece of paper towel and peel the membrane off the rack. (If you leave the membrane on, the ribs will be chewy.)
Spread the dry rub all over each rack of ribs until completely coated. Make sure you press the dry rub into the meat. This is where your flavor is going to come from. Arrange the ribs in a rib rack, with all the racks facing the same direction. A rib rack has 8 slab compartments, looks like a rack of coat hangers and can be purchased at most barbecue stores.
Fire up your charcoal grill and prep the grill for cooking over indirect heat. You need a low temperature of around 250 to 300°F (120 to 150°C) to grill the ribs. For gas grills, preheat the grill to low then turn off one side of the grill to achieve indirect heat. Place a drip tray on the cooler side of the grate and half fill the pan with warm water or the beer of your choice.
Drain 2 chunks of hickory, place them on top of the charcoal and set the grate in place. For gas barbecues, place half of the hickory chips in a foil pouch and place the pouch directly on the heated side of the grill. Wait for the hickory to start to smoke.
Place the rib racks over indirect heat as far from the heat as possible, with the bone sides facing toward the heat. Close the lid and close the top vent on a charcoal grill about halfway. This will maintain a temperature between 250 and 300°F (120 and 150°C). Cook the ribs for 2 hours.
Once the ribs are on, it’s time to start working on the barbecue sauce. If you have a side burner this can be done outside. If you don’t, go inside and use your stove top to simmer your sauce. Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan set over medium heat. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes or until the sauce reaches a glaze consistency. Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool.
The first batch of charcoal should be cooling down after 2 hours. Now is the time to use your chimney starter and get another batch of charcoal lit. Add the remaining wood chunks to the coals to get a little more smoke. If using a gas grill, wrap the remaining chips in foil and place directly on the hotter side of the grate. Close the lid and grill for another 2 hours. Make sure to come back every hour on the hour to check the temperature and to add more charcoal, if necessary. In the last hour of grilling, your ribs will start to show signs of cooking all the way through. When the meat pulls back from the bone, the ribs are almost ready. Baste the ribs with the barbecue sauce during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking.

Pour the batter evenly into the pans and rap them on the countertop several times to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pans from shelf to shelf so they bake evenly and bake until the tops spring back when lightly touched, about 25 minutes altogether. Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 15 minutes.
Run a knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely. Once they’re cool, refrigerate the cakes for 20 to 30 minutes to make icing them easier.

Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
To make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it’s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up.
To make the purée, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.
To make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn’t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150°F (65°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved.
Remove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don’t panic—this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble.
Unwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don’t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it’s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry purée on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top.
Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I’ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).",roasted-strawberry-layer-cake-new-way-to-cake,"['Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour', '2½ tsp (11 g) baking powder', '3 tbsp (45 ml) milk', '2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial', '1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter', '1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine/caster sugar', 'Zest of 1 lemon', '4 eggs', 'Approximately 1 lb (400–450 g) fresh strawberries', '¼ cup (50 g) superfine/caster sugar', '2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste', '½ cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites', '1 cup (200 g) superfine/caster sugar', '1⅓ cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened', '6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial', 'Fresh strawberries, to decorate', 'Fresh elderflower', 'to decorate']"

Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you’ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the ½ tablespoon until it appears just moistened—a dough that’s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.
Preheat the oven to 375°F.
Using the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, rotating 90 degrees after each roll, and adding a bit more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Drape the rolled dough over a rolling pin and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a clean rim of about an inch, and pile the fruit on top. Fold the crust around over the fruit, pleating rustically as you go. Brush the exposed pastry with water, then sprinkle generously—over the crust and the fruit, too—with sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake until the fruit juices are bubbling in the center and the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes, or more depending on the fruit.

Soak the rice in water, generously covered, for at least 30 minutes. (This is optional but results in softer, more evenly cooked rice.) Drain thoroughly using a fine-mesh sieve.
In a soup pot, dry-roast and stir the lentils continuously over medium heat until they are golden brown and have a nutty aroma, 2 to 3 minutes. (This step is optional but reduces the stickiness of the dal.) Thoroughly wash the lentils using a fine mesh colander. Return them to the pot, together with the rice, and add 3 1⁄2 cups of water.

(Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)
Whisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.
Pulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.
Using a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.
Roll out dough into a rough 8"" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4"" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4"" square. Roll dough back out to an 8"" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4"" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.

Grease a 10"" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8"" square. Fold in half into an 8x4"" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4"" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12"" square about ¼"" thick. Dollop date purée all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a ½"" border without purée along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over purée.
Starting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about ½"" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1"" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.
Cover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until they’re doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1–1½ hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.

Morton kosher salt, divided', '12 scallions, thinly sliced on a deepdiagonal', '2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard', '2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated (about 2 cups)', 'Freshly ground black pepper']","Whisk sugar, salt, and 1½ cups flour in a medium bowl to combine. Add butter and toss to combine. Using your hands and working quickly, rub and smash butter into flat, irregular pieces (be careful not to overwork; you don’t want to soften the butter too much).1 Drizzle ⅓ cup cold water over and mix with a rubber spatula, smashing in butter, until dough mostly comes together—it will be dry and shaggy.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface. Working quickly and using a rolling pin and your hands, press dough together to form a mass. Roll dough into a rough square about ½"" thick. Fold in half into a rectangle, then once again to make a small square. Press down on the dough with rolling pin to make it hold together. Roll dough out once more to make a rough square about ½"" thick. Repeat folding process, taking your time to make it neat as this will be your final fold. Using rolling pin, gently flatten dough, rotating as needed, to make a 6""-diameter disk.
Dust surface with more flour and roll disk into a 14""-diameter circle or oval about ⅛"" thick. Fold dough in half, then in half again to make a rough triangle (this will make it easier to move). Slide onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and unfold. Chill while you make the filling.
Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Wrap 6"" disk tightly and chill until ready to roll out.
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°F. Heat 3 Tbsp. butter in a medium skillet over medium until foaming, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; add onion, garlic, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton salt, and stir to combine. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is tender and just beginning to brown, 6–8 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally and adding a splash of water if onion begins to stick, until golden brown in spots, about 5 minutes more. Transfer onion mixture to a plate; reserve skillet.
Melt remaining 1 Tbsp. butter in reserved skillet (no need to wipe out) over medium heat. Remove from heat and add scallions and remaining ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Toss scallions until coated in butter.
Remove dough from refrigerator and, using a small offset spatula or a spoon, spread mustard in a thin layer over dough, leaving a 1½""–2"" border around the edges. Scatter onion mixture over mustard and sprinkle with Parmesan; season with pepper. Cutting from edge of dough to the start of the mustard and filling, make slits in border of galette at 2""–3"" intervals. Fold flaps up and over filling, slightly overlapping. Scatter scallions over. Bake galette until crust is deep golden brown and scallions are lightly charred, 45–50 minutes. Using parchment paper, slide galette onto a cutting board and cut into wedges.

Add flour and salt; mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.
Pour 4 Tbsp. oil into the biggest bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.
Generously butter a 13x9"" baking pan (for thicker focaccia that’s perfect for sandwiches) or an 18x13"" rimmed baking sheet. Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (Using a fork in each hand makes this process even easier and less messy!)
Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over the dough and coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot until doubled in size, at least 1½ hours and up to 4 hours. To see if it’s ready, poke the dough with your finger. The dough should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you can chill it up to 1 hour.)
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°F. Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you may not need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, as if you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20–30 minutes.
Melt 4 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat and grate in garlic (use 2 cloves if you’re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, about 45 seconds. Brush garlic butter all over focaccia.

Using a rubber spatula, mix in yolks. (Dough should hold together when squeezed.)
Scrape dough into prepared pan and gently press into an even layer (lightly flour your hands if needed). Prick dough with a fork in several spots (this will help it stay flat as it bakes).
Bake shortbread until golden brown, 24–28 minutes (or up to 35 minutes if using a glass dish). Let cool slightly.
While the shortbread is cooling, heat brown sugar and butter, whisking constantly, in a heavy medium saucepan over medium until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, whisking constantly, until butterscotch is thick enough to coat a spoon (bubbling will become less frequent), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add tahini and vanilla and whisk until incorporated and smooth.
Pour butterscotch over shortbread and tilt pan to distribute evenly. Chill until set, 30–40 minutes.
Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave in 40-second increments, stirring between bursts. (Alternatively, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water; bowl should not touch water. Heat, stirring often, until melted and smooth.) Pour over butterscotch and spread evenly to edges of pan; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Chill until chocolate is firm, 1–2 hours.
Using parchment paper overhang, pull bars out of pan and set on a cutting board; remove parchment. Using a serrated knife, slice into 25–36 pieces (5–6 cuts in each direction). Bring to room temperature before serving.

In a medium bowl, mix together the coconut and paprika and season with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with 1 tablespoon water.
Make an assembly line with the shrimp, egg wash, coconut mixture, and prepared baking sheet. Dip the shrimp in the egg wash, then dredge in the coconut, lightly shaking off any excess, then place the coated shrimp on the baking rack. Repeat with the remaining shrimp, spacing them out evenly on the baking rack so they will get crispy instead of steaming.
Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, until the shrimp are cooked through and the coconut has started to brown.
While the shrimp are cooking, make the salsa and sauce. In a medium bowl, toss together the salsa ingredients and set aside.
In a food processor or high-powered blender, add the sauce ingredients and ⅓ cup water. Pulse until smooth, adjusting the seasonings to your taste. If desired, spoon the sauce into a small zip-top bag and cut the tip off of one of the bottom corners (like you would to make a piping bag for icing), just enough to make a small hole.

Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt', '1½ cups (188 g) all-purpose flour', '½ cup carrot juice', '½ cup heavy cream', '½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar', '¼ tsp. kosher salt', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter']","Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Lightly coat bottom and sides of a 9""-diameter cake pan with oil. Line bottom of pan with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate any air bubbles.
Grate carrots on the large holes of a box grater. Measure out 2½ cups (lightly packed; 250 g); reserve remaining carrots for another use (like raita!).
Set a fine-mesh sieve over a measuring glass and place next to stove. Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add pistachios and cook, stirring often, until butter browns and nuts smell toasty, about 5 minutes. (Butter will get very foamy and it will be hard to see what’s going on, so once the foam is golden brown, remove pan from heat every 10 seconds to check how the nuts are browning.) Pour mixture through prepared sieve, scraping in all of the browned bits; set nuts and butter aside.
Crack eggs into a large bowl; add brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 3 minutes (mixture should be thick, pale, and increased in volume). Decrease speed to medium-high and gradually stream in reserved brown butter (including browned bits); beat until combined. Coarsely chop reserved pistachios. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour until almost completely combined, then add nuts and carrots and continue to fold until everything is incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Place pan on a clean smooth surface and give it a fast 360-degree spin (this pushes the batter up the sides of the pan and minimizes doming during baking).
Bake cake until deeply browned and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50–55 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a small offset spatula or butter knife around perimeter of cake to loosen. Place a plate upside down over cake and invert cake onto plate (leave flat side up). Remove parchment paper.
Do Ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
Place a small plate in the freezer. Cook carrot juice, cream, granulated sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat (do not stir) until thick like lava, 8–10 minutes. Mixture will initially bubble and foam vigorously and look like it’s going to boil over, but it won’t! Don’t be tempted to reduce the heat; the bubbling will subside and mixture will thicken. You want it to be thick enough to stick to the cake, but do not let it brown. Test glaze by putting a small dollop onto the cold plate: When you run your finger through the glaze, it should leave a defined trail.
Once the glaze is thick enough, remove pan from heat and stir in butter. Let cool until you can comfortably hold your finger in it (if it’s too hot, it will run right off the cake), about 15 minutes.
Stir glaze well and pour over center of cake, nudging to the edges with offset spatula or butter knife. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick.

Add the tequila and allow to infuse for 12 to 20 minutes, depending on spice level desired. Rebottle.
Note: The recipe for the jalapeño tequila will vary because not all jalapeños are equally spicy. You need to taste it frequently to make sure it’s right. Ensure your tequila is not cold, as cold tequila will not infuse properly.

Fold in remaining ½ cup plus 2 Tbsp. (78 g total) flour. Then add eggs, milk, granulated sugar, baking soda, salt, and 3 Tbsp. melted butter and whisk, adding more milk if needed, until mixture is thick but pourable (you want it to be about the consistency of heavy cream). It will take awhile to work out lumps—a few small lumps are fine, but try to get batter as smooth as possible.
Pour in enough oil to lightly coat a crepe pan or 10"" nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high (this is just to help get things going; you shouldn’t need to add more oil to the pan).

Whisk 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. milk, 2 tsp. food-coloring powder, and half of salt in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; add more milk if needed. For a deeper color, whisk in more powder 1 tsp. at a time until desired color is achieved; adjust with milk if needed. Repeat with second food-coloring powder, remaining salt, remaining 1 cup powdered sugar, and remaining 3 Tbsp. milk, adjusting intensity of color as desired.
Spoon 1 tsp. first glaze in the center of a small plate. Drizzle 1 tsp. second glaze over the first and use a toothpick to slightly swirl colors together; don’t go overboard. (If you want to decorate larger cookies, add 1 tsp. glaze to plate for each additional inch.)
Gently press the top of a cookie into glaze, then lift up and allow excess glaze to drip back onto the plate. Using a toothpick, pop any air bubbles and swirl colors more if desired. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 2 more cookies, adding ½ tsp. of each color of glaze to plate before each cookie is dipped. The glaze will lose its swirly effect at this point. Clean plate and repeat process, decorating cookies in batches of 3 until all cookies have been glazed.

Divide dough in half. Working one at a time, roll each piece into a 10""-long log. Wrap each log tightly in plastic and roll across work surface to make as smooth and cylindrical as possible. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until surface is firm, about 20 minutes.
Slap a log down onto counter to create a flat side; roll over and slap again to flatten another side (you’re aiming for a triangular shape). Repeat to create third side of the triangle.

(or more) whole milk', 'Coarse white sanding sugar and edible glitter (for decorating)']","Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toss pecans, maple syrup, and ½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Scrape onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and spread nuts into a single layer. Bake until pecans are slightly darkened and syrup is dark and bubbling, 15–20 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully toss pecans in hot syrup to coat again. Let cool on baking sheet until caramel hardens, about 30 minutes. Break up candied pecans into pieces; discard any burned bits.
Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Generously butter a 10"" cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet; line bottom with a round of parchment paper and butter parchment. Pulse flour, brown sugar, half of candied pecans, and 1¼ tsp. salt in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add egg, 1 Tbsp. vanilla, and remaining 10 Tbsp. butter and process until a shaggy dough forms.
Transfer dough to a large bowl and knead a couple of times just to bring it together. Using damp hands, pat dough evenly into skillet, extending all the way to the sides of the pan. Bake cookie until edges are golden brown and center is slightly puffed, 30–35 minutes. Let cool in skillet 1 hour. Invert cookie onto a cutting board and cut into 16 wedges. Turn right side up and transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet.
Whisk powdered sugar, milk, remaining ¼ tsp. salt, and remaining 1 tsp. vanilla in a small wide bowl until smooth. The glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; thin with more milk if needed. Transfer half of the glaze to another small wide bowl (you’ll need to use 2 bowls as the glaze will start to collect crumbs and you’ll want a fresh start).
Working one at a time, lightly dip half of the wedges, top side down, into first bowl of glaze so that only the surface is covered and no glaze drips down the sides. Use a toothpick to pop any bubbles and smooth glaze; coating should be thin enough to see the cookie peeking through. Repeat with remaining wedges and second bowl of glaze.
Top wedges with remaining candied pecans and let sit 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sanding sugar and glitter and let sit until glaze is set, about 1 hour.

Add Swiss chard leaves to skillet a handful at a time, tossing and letting them wilt slightly between additions, until all the leaves have been added. Cook, reducing heat as needed (liquid should be bubbling slightly at this point), until liquid is almost completely evaporated (it’s important to dry out the Swiss chard here so the filling isn’t soggy), about 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl. Let cool 5 minutes, then stir in ricotta. Season filling with salt.
If using pasta sheets, cook in a pot of boiling salted water 1 minute. Transfer to a large bowl of cold water. Lay out a row of pasta sheets on a rimmed baking sheet (don’t overlap), then top with a sheet of waxed or parchment paper. Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, placing sheets of paper between each layer.
If using shells, cook in a pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, just until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package instructions; rinse under cold water to cool quickly.
Preheat oven to 375°F. Spread half of béchamel into a 13x9"" baking dish. If using pasta sheets, lay out a sheet on a clean surface with a short end facing you. Spoon a heaping ¼-cupful of filling so it runs all the way down the center. Roll pasta around filling to create a 1 1/4""-diameter tube (the pasta will overlap quite a bit). Repeat with remaining pasta sheets, arranging in baking dish as you go to create 2 rows. If using shells, spoon a heaping tablespoonful of filling into each shell and nestle next to each other to create rows (you’ll have about 5 rows of 6 shells each).

Season the chicken with 3⁄4 teaspoon of the salt and gently place it in the pan. Cook on one side until almost cooked all the way through, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook on the other side for about 30 seconds, or until it is no longer pink. Transfer the chicken to a plate to rest.
Immediately add the yellow onion and the remaining 2 teaspoons vegetable oil to the pan. Stir and cook for 5 minutes, or until the onion is dark and smells amazing but is not burnt. If it’s getting too dark, lower the heat. Add the vinegar, along with the liquid that has collected on the plate where the chicken is resting, and turn the heat to low. Simmer the onion for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the liquid has evaporated. Transfer the onion to a bowl, using a rubber spatula to scrape the pan out completely. When the onion has cooled down a little, about 5 minutes, add the red onion, scallions, fried shallots, and remaining 1⁄4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine.
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the same pan. Lay out two slices of bread on your work surface and place a slice of cheese on each. Top each piece of cheese with half of the onions, two pieces of chicken, and another slice of cheese, and cover with another slice of bread. Place the sandwiches in the pan with the melted butter. Cook over medium heat, about 3 minutes, until the cheese on the bottom slice is melted and the bread is nicely toasted. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and flip the sandwiches.

Put the chicken in a large mixing bowl and pour the marinade over it, reserving about 1⁄2 cup marinade in a small bowl, and covering and refrigerating it. Mix the chicken well with the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24. The acidic marinade will start to break down the chicken, so if a more tender texture bothers you, marinate for 4 to 5 hours. I, however, am a fan of that texture and think an aggressively long, 24-hour marinade gives the chicken that much more flavor.
Heat a grill until it is so hot you (almost) can’t look directly at it. Skewer the chicken; you can make a giant skewer to save space or lots of little ones for easier turning. Cook the skewered chicken, turning three times, until nicely charred, 5 to 7 minutes on each of the four sides. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then take it off the skewers.

Note: This cake can be made with nearly any citrus, my favorite being lemon because I like it to be bitter and tart. The only citrus I would not use is raw grapefruit, oro blanco, or lime.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg and mix to combine. With the machine running, add the leftover starter, ricotta, lime zest, and vanilla. Depending on the temperature of your ingredients, the mixture may become lumpy—this is okay.
Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. On low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once more, making sure that there is no flour hiding at the bottom. It will smell wonderful. Cover the bowl in plastic wrap and chill the dough for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Then portion the dough onto your sheet pans using a tablespoon or mini ice cream scoop.
Place both sheet pans into the oven and bake for about 15 to 17 minutes. Rotate the pans and swap racks at the halfway mark for even coloring. When finished, the cookies will be pale yellow with golden bottoms and will feel soft to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack.
For the glaze, sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl. Add the juice of 1 lime and whisk until a smooth glaze forms. If the texture is too thick, add more lime juice as needed until you achieve a pourable consistency.
Once the cookies are completely cool, drizzle some of the glaze over the top. Finish with grated lime zest to decorate.

Transfer the oil mixture to a blender. Add the cilantro, lemon juice, jalapeño, and ¼ cup water and blend until smooth. If necessary, season with additional salt to taste. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
First, press your tofu. This procedure extracts excess water, makes the block more uniformly firm, and allows the tofu to absorb the marinade more easily. Just wrap the block of tofu in a clean kitchen towel (or paper towels), place it in a large bowl or a clean kitchen sink, and sit something heavy on top of it (like a 28-ounce can of tomatoes) for 20 minutes, turning the block over after 15 minutes.
Place one block of the tofu on a cutting board. Cut it in half horizontally, then cut vertically down the center to yield four pieces. Repeat with the second block of tofu.
Pour the marinade into a large baking dish, adding just enough water to ensure that it is runny, if necessary. Place the tofu in the marinade in one even layer. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, flipping the tofu every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours. Remove the tofu from the marinade, scrape off any excess, and transfer to a large plate. Strain the marinade through a fine-mesh sieve and set aside.
In a large pot, bring 2 quarts water to a boil over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Blanch the collard leaves, one at a time, for 30 seconds each, then lay them flat on clean kitchen towels to dry.
Combine the arrowroot and the remaining 2 tea¬spoons salt in a pie plate. Mix well. Coat each side of the tofu pieces with the arrowroot, shake off any excess arrowroot, and transfer them to a second large plate.
Lightly coat the bottom of a large cast-iron skillet with peanut oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the tofu and fry until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently flip each piece with a spatula and fry until golden brown on the second side. Lightly sprinkle both sides of the tofu with salt and transfer to a rack. Repeat to fry the remaining tofu. Wipe the skillet clean.
On a clean work surface, arrange two collard leaves lengthwise, overlapping each other by an inch or so, and place one piece of tofu in the center of the leaves. Smear 2 heaping tablespoons of the reserved marinade on top of the tofu, sprinkle a heaping teaspoon of garlic chips on top of the tofu, then fold the leaves around the tofu to create a packet. Repeat with the remaining collard leaves and tofu.
In the same skillet, warm 2 tablespoons peanut oil over medium-high heat, tilting the pan to coat it evenly with the oil. Place the packets in the skillet, folded-side up, and cook for about 1 minute. Gently flip each packet with a spatula, cover the skillet with a lid or some aluminum foil, and cook for about 5 minutes to warm through.
To serve, spread some cilantro sauce over four plates and place two of the tofu packets on each plate.

Add 1 tablespoon of the oil, the onions, and 3 of the garlic cloves. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until the onions and garlic start to color. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for 25 minutes, or until caramelized.
Add the beans, tomatoes, thyme, the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, ¼ teaspoon salt, and 1 cup of the water. Turn the heat up to medium- high and bring to a simmer. Smash about one-eighth of the beans against the side of the pan with a fork to thicken the mixture. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.
Transfer to a bowl, discard the thyme, and smash the garlic cloves. Season with salt and pepper, stir well, and cover with foil to keep warm.
Preheat the broiler.
Rinse out the pan and return it to the stovetop. Add the confit duck leg skin-side down to the cold pan. Turn the heat to medium-low, add the remaining 1 tablespoon water, cover the pan, and cook for 10 minutes (when the skin softens, scrape it off the duck leg and continue cooking alongside it; this will become the crackling). Remove the lid, turn the duck leg, and continue cooking until the leg is warmed through and starting to crisp up, turning as needed.
Continue cooking the duck skin (as if it were a slice of bacon) until nice and crisp, keeping in mind that it will crisp more as it cools (as if it were a slice of bacon), about 3 minutes longer. Drain on a paper towel.
Toast the bread on both sides under the broiler until it is crisp on the outside and still soft inside. Rub each slice generously with the remaining garlic clove and top each slice with about ½ cup of the beans. Shred the duck meat and divide it evenly among the toasts.

The first step before you press is the same: Drain the liquid from the box of tofu. Then press.
Method 1: (Easiest) Use a tofu-pressing machine! I spotted one of these in Torrance, California, at a little Japanese grocery store. You place a block of tofu in between two plates and turn a small crank to compress it. Though it will press only one block at a time—the boxes of tofu we use come four to a box—you can set it and forget it (but do it three more times if you plan on using all the tofu).
Method 2: (Most common) Use two similar-size plates or relatively flat surfaces. Lay out the blocks of tofu flat in a single layer on one of the plates, and then put the second plate on top of the tofu. Press the tofu by placing at least 10 pounds of weight on top of the second plate.
Method 3: (Most “professional”) We still prepare the tofu this way at our restaurant, which is, without question, the most efficient way to prepare larger servings. Lay baking racks/grates inside baking sheets, then cover racks with clean (lint-free) towels or, as we did successfully for four years, with neatly folded aprons laid in a single layer as level and as flat as possible across the racks. Yup, towels or aprons, plural. Because tofu holds so much moisture, the liquid constantly spills over, and we’ve found very few people who just live to clean. To absorb the moisture, and to create much less of a mess, we started using layers of cloth.
Lay out the tofu on the covered racks in a single layer, organized as tightly as possible. Make sure the tofu doesn’t hang over the sides of the sheets or it won’t be pressed evenly. Next, lay another towel/apron on top of the layer of tofu, again, flat and level. Then lay another equal-size baking sheet + covered rack + tofu on top of that. Repeat the same steps as needed. The top layer should be a baking sheet on which you place 30 to 40 pounds of “stuff” to press down on all the layers. No matter how many layers you stack, the tofu should flatten out only slightly, not be completely crushed.
Processing the tofu is far simpler than pressing it, though like pressing, there are three different ways to do it. Start with a bowl or a large (22-quart) plastic container made by and known as a Cambro (if you have one of those lying around), and do one of the following:
Method 1: Use a food mill, which is what we use. This is by far the easiest way to process tofu and get the most consistent texture (and it’s a great method for mashing anything).
Method 2: Use a potato masher. Just mash away, but you’ll still need to use the third option to smash out any little lumps that the masher doesn’t, um, well, mash.
Method 3: Mash everything with your hands. (This is the most common way.)
Process the tofu until it is a consistent, almost pasty texture. If you go with No. 2 or No. 3, make sure to smash out all lumps from the tofu or else the seasoning won’t evenly distribute throughout the mix and, later, the balls.
Add chopped scallions, mushroom bouillon, corn, and ground white pepper to the (hopefully) evenly processed tofu. Stick your hands in (maybe with gloves) and mix all the ingredients. Taste some of the mix from different areas of the bowl/container to make sure it’s evenly seasoned. It should taste savory, with little bits of scallion and corn in every bite.
Now it’s ball-rolling time! Scoop out a tablespoon of the tofu mixture, hand-pack it tightly into the spoon, then level out the spoon with your finger. Assertively shake or scoop out the mix into your hand while mostly keeping it in one piece. Firmly clench the tofu by making a fist, packing it very tightly so it doesn’t fall apart.
Continue by shaping into a ball, either with one hand or by lightly tossing the ball back and forth between both hands like you’re playing catch with yourself. Lightly roll the tofu between your hands, moving your hands in an alternating clockwise motion, like you would forming a meatball, only more gently to smooth out any cracks. Tofu is very docile; the more you do it, the better you’ll get the feel of it (like most things in life). Place tofu balls on a plate or (ideally) a baking sheet rack.
Optional: Refrigerate the balls overnight, uncovered. This will firm them up.
Add flour, water, and mushroom bouillon to a bowl. Mix together. It should not be lumpy; the consistency should be not too thin and consistently thick enough to adhere, but not so thick it doesn’t drip off your finger.
Empty the green rice flakes into a separate bowl or catering pan, then mix in half of the dry cornstarch with flakes. Next, drop balls into flour paste. Shake off excess paste (we highly recommend using a kitchen “spider” strainer to do this), then roll balls around in the flakes until they’re fully coated. Gently clench the balls to pack one last bit of flakes onto the balls. If flakes start to drop off the balls, mix in more of the remaining cornstarch to dry flakes, then try again.
Set balls on a rack.
Optional: If you plan on making more and hate waste like we do, clean and dry your hands, then sift through all the flakes. Throw out any moist clumps of flakes. Store dry flakes in a closed container, then refrigerate until your next tofu ball–rolling party!
Optional: Refrigerate the fully flaked balls uncovered (and preferably elevated on a rack) overnight. This will give the flakes more time to adhere and dry out, which is important in giving the balls more puff, crunch, and an overall prettier look after frying.
Add at least 2 inches of oil to a pot, bring to 350°F over high heat, then fry the balls for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the flakes puff up bright green and any exposed tofu turns a slight golden color. If the balls start turning brown, the oil’s too hot or you’re frying them for too long. If the balls look oily or wet after frying, either the temperature is too low or you’re frying too many balls at once, which lowers the temperature of the oil too quickly.
Remove from oil, shake off excess, drip dry on a rack.

331,Risotto With Mushrooms and Thyme,"['1 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more', '6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '½ large white onion, finely chopped', '2 cups carnaroli or Japanese sushi rice', '1 cup dry white wine', '5 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated', '¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil', '1 lb. mushrooms (such as shiitake, crimini, or maitake), trimmed, caps torn into (2"") pieces', 'Kosher salt', 'Freshly ground pepper', '5 sprigs thyme', '5 garlic cloves, crushed', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter', '2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice', '1 oz. Parmesan, finely grated']","Combine 1 Tbsp. salt and 10 cups water in a medium pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium to maintain a bare simmer.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a 6-qt. Dutch oven over medium. Add onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until onion is translucent and starting to soften, 6–8 minutes. Add ½ cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and tender, about 5 minutes. Taste onion; if it’s still firm at all, add a splash of water and continue to cook until meltingly soft.
Add rice and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains are translucent around the edges and make a clattering sound when they hit against the pot, about 5 minutes. (Coating grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the outside does not become mushy before the center is tender.) Add wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine evaporates, about 2 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water to rice in ¾-cup increments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and suspended in a fluid, not-too-thick creamy liquid, 25–30 minutes. It should take 2–3 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are key to encouraging starches to release from risotto, creating its trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but the finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking rice about 15 minutes after the first water addition; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn’t leave a chalky residue between your teeth after tasting. Do not overcook!
Remove pot from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Gradually add Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid is creamy but very loose; stir in more hot salted water if needed. Taste and season with more salt.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add mushrooms; cook, tossing occasionally, until they begin to soften and release some liquid, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; cook, tossing occasionally, until deeply browned and tender, 8–10 minutes. Add thyme, garlic, and butter and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic softens and butter is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add vinegar. Toss to coat, scraping up any browned bits. Pluck out thyme.

In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and ¼ teaspoon of the salt and set aside. In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-low heat until a few drops of water added to the pan sizzle and evaporate. Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes, just until the eggs form fluffy curds but have not fully set; they should still be slightly runny. Remove from the heat and let cool in a medium bowl.
Use your hands to gently fold the eggs, sesame oil, oyster sauce, remaining 1¼ teaspoons of salt, and pepper together until fully combined. Gently fold in the spinach and mix until fully incorporated.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Holding a wrapper in your palm, use a fork to add about 1 tablespoon of the filling to the center of the wrapper, then lightly pat down the filling with the fork to get rid of any air bubbles.
Fold the dumpling into the round yuan bao shape: Cradle the wrapper in your hands and fold the edge closest to you over the filling. Lightly squeeze the dumpling to push out any air bubbles. Clasp one end of the dumpling between your thumb and index finger to pinch it shut; repeat on the other side of the dumpling. Cradle the dumpling in your palms, clasping the sealed edge between your thumbs and index fingers, and squeeze it shut while pushing inward, making sure to squeeze out any air bubbles. The dumpling's belly should form a teardrop shape between your thumbs, which will create the yuan bao shape.

Wrap the zucchini in a clean cheesecloth or tea towel and squeeze to wring out excess moisture.
In a medium bowl, add the lamb and slowly pour in the peppercorn-infused water, a few drops at a time, and use your hands to mix it in well until the water is fully absorbed. Add the scallions, wine, ginger, soy sauce, and salt, and mix well until fully incorporated. Gently fold in the zucchini and mix until well combined.

379,Boiled or Panfried Dumpling Dough,"['2 cups all-purpose flour', '1⁄8 teaspoon kosher salt', '¾ cup lukewarm water', '1 egg white']","Mix the Dough: Add the flour to a wide mixing bowl and stir in the salt. Stir in the water and egg white with your fingers. The flour will look shaggy, like biscuit dough; as the dough comes together, run an open palm around the edge of the bowl and fold the flour into the center, spinning the bowl with your other hand as you go, until it all forms a rough clump. It’s fine if there are still pockets of dry flour.
Knead the Dough: Coat your work surface with a fine dusting of flour and turn the dough out of the bowl. Dust your hands with flour and shape the dough into a fat log about the width of your hand. Knead the dough by pushing your hands and wrists into the log and rolling it forward. Then roll it back and push again. Repeat a few times until the log moves easily, adding more flour if it sticks, then spin the log 90 degrees, shape it into a horizontal log again, and knead a few more times, adding more flour if necessary. Use no more flour than you need to keep the dough from drying out. As you knead, the dough will get firmer and tougher with a texture reminiscent of a gummy bear. It’s ready when it’s smooth to the touch, like the surface of a pearl, not tacky, with no cracks or pockets of dry flour. There may be some lumps. Put the dough back in your work bowl and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Let it sleep for 15 to 30 minutes. While it relaxes, you can prepare your filling.Knead Again: Dust your work surface with a little more flour, then knead it as before. Work out all those lumps; after kneading about ten times you should have satin-smooth dough that forms a clean ball you can easily push into, like the gel of a shoe insert.Portion the Dough: Form your dough into a log, dust a dough scraper with a little flour, and cut the dough into four equal sections. Roll each section into a log and chop it into six pieces for a total of twenty-four balls of dough, each about an inch in diameter. Toss the balls with a light coating of flour and cover with a lightly moistened towel.Roll the Dough Into Wrappers: Gently smash the balls of dough into flat disks, then lightly roll an Asian-style rolling pin across them to flatten them out a bit more. Hold one disk by its edge and firmly but gently roll your pin from the disk’s edge to its center. Roll the same edge a few more times, using more pressure at the edge than at the center. Use your other hand to turn the dough disk and reveal a new edge of the disk; roll again. Continue until all edges are rolled out and the wrapper is about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Hold your rolled-out wrapper up to a light. If you can see through it faintly, your wrapper is ready to go. Otherwise, keep rolling. Roll the edges to half the thickness of the center of the wrappers. As you get faster, you’ll notice that all your active hand needs to do is roll the pin back and forth while your other hand just rotates the wrapper. As long as your hands stay in these fixed motions, you’ll easily make even, round wrappers though they don’t need to be perfectly uniform. Place freshly rolled wrappers under a lightly moistened towel to keep them from drying out.",boiled-or-panfried-dumpling-dough-helen-you-dumpling-galaxy-wrappers,"['2 cups all-purpose flour', '1⁄8 teaspoon kosher salt', '¾ cup lukewarm water', '1 egg white']"

Cut the lavash into 12 strips 3 in [7.5 cm] thick and about 12 in [30.5 cm] long. Keep cut lavash covered or in a plastic bag so the strips don’t dry out.
To shape each triangle, position a strip of lavash in front of you vertically. Place about 2 Tbsp of bean paste at the bottom end of the strip.

Line a plate with paper towels. Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat.

Pulse mint and granulated sugar in a food processor until mint is finely chopped. Add butter; process to combine. Add dry ingredients and pulse again to combine. Add egg and egg yolk; pulse until a shaggy dough forms.
Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead just until dough holds its shape. Divide dough in half; pat each portion into a 1""-thick disk. Wrap disks in plastic and chill until firm, at least 2 hours.
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to about ¼"" thick, dusting with more flour as needed to keep from sticking. Punch out rounds with lightly floured cookie cutter and arrange on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1"" apart. Pat dough scraps into a 1""-thick disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 10 minutes if soft. Repeat process with scraps.
Hold a bench scraper or straightedge upright 1"" from edge of a cookie to cordon off a shallow semicircle (do not press down into dough; you’re just making a barrier). Coat semicircle with sanding sugar; gently press to adhere. Remove scraper; you should have a tidy sugared edge. Repeat with remaining cookies and more sanding sugar.
Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are lightly browned, 10–12 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to 2 wire racks set inside 2 rimmed baking sheets; let cool completely.
Sift powdered sugar and cocoa powder into a medium bowl. Add corn syrup, a pinch of salt, and 2 Tbsp. warm water and stir until smooth and glossy.
Position bench scraper to make another shallow semicircle on the other side of the cookie, angling it so that it forms a V with the sugared edge, lightly pressing scraper into cookie to make a barrier. Spoon 1 tsp. glaze onto exposed semicircle and use a toothpick to help coat evenly; excess will drip over sides. Lift scraper straight up and over chocolate side to create a neat edge.

402,Malaysian Chicken Curry with Buttermilk Beer Beignets,"['1 ⅓ tablespoons Yeo brand Malaysian curry powder', '1 teaspoon sugar', '1 teaspoon kosher salt', '1 teaspoon chicken bouillon', '1 pound dark meat chicken (cut, uncut, bone-on, boneless)', '⅔ cup coconut milk', '2 ⅔ tablespoons whole milk', '2 ½ teaspoons sambal badjak (an Indonesian chili paste with minced onions and dried shrimp)', '¼ yellow or white onion, sliced', '2 makrut lime leaves, ripped in half widthwise', '⅓ pound Okinawan sweet potatoes (aka Hawaiian purple sweet potatoes), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes', '⅓ pound carrots, cut into 1 ½-inch-long pieces', 'Buttermilk Beer Beignets (optional)', 'Scallions, coarsely chopped, for garnish']","Combine curry powder, sugar, salt, and chicken bouillon in a mixing bowl and hand mix together until it’s all one love, one mix.
Rinse chicken under water, pat dry with paper towels, then transfer to a mixing bowl. Next, pour the beautiful curry spice mix all over that chicken. Mix and rub the spices all over the chicken until no chicken remains uncovered with spice. Cover it all up, like it’s your only goal in life.
Marinate overnight. Alternatively, if you’re in a hurry, marinate for 1 hour, though the curry mix won’t fully penetrate the chicken or touch the souls of others, which is what eating is all about.
When ready to cook, you’ll need a pan to sauté with and a pot for stewing and braising.
Combine coconut milk, whole milk, and sambal badjak in pot.
Next, heat the sauté pan to medium-high heat. Add a little bit of cooking oil, add some onions and some lime leaves, and sear batches of chicken until chicken turns golden brown all around, while sweating onions and leaves. Do not cook the chicken through; just brown and sear. The lime leaves will fill your kitchen with their incredible citrus scent—a pretty amazing smell.
After each batch is evenly seared, transfer into pot. To ensure the chicken cooks evenly, do not heat up the pot until all chicken is seared. Continue searing onions, lime leaves, and chicken. Once all chicken is seared, sauté any remaining lime leaves, and onions, and transfer to the pot before cooking. If there is any excess spice mix in the chicken marinade bowl, also transfer into the pot because the spice mix is measured specifically to give the best flavor for the curry sauce itself and not just the marinade.
Bring pot to a boil over high heat, then simmer covered with a slight opening for 35–45 minutes, or until the chicken is tender but not falling apart. The curry consistency should be thin and almost milky. Once chicken is done, turn off heat.
While waiting for the chicken to finish cooking, prepare an ice water bath in a bowl. Bring 2 inches of water to a rolling boil in a pot over high heat. Cook the sweet potatoes in the boiling water for 6–8 minutes. Check often to see when the potatoes are cooked through; they should be crunchy, still firm and not mushy. Once they’re done, remove the potatoes from pot (but do not dump the boiling water; save it for blanching the carrots) and shock them immediately in the ice water bath for 2 minutes, or until they are completely cool to the touch. Strain and set aside cooked potatoes in a fresh bowl.
Next, blanch the carrots by repeating the steps as for the potatoes, checking for nonmushy doneness. If you use baby carrots, they take about 4–5 minutes to blanch. Adjust time accordingly for the type of carrots you’re using and how they’re cut. Cook, shock, strain, then set aside with the potatoes.
Chicken can be served immediately, but it will be most flavorful if cooled down, stored, and covered overnight in the fridge, and then reheated and served the next day. Blanched potatoes and carrots can also be stored overnight.
When ready to serve (not long before—just right when you are ready to serve), add carrots and potatoes to the hot chicken curry. Garnish with scallions. Serve with steamed rice, and if you want to soak up that curry deliciousness (my favorite part), sop it up with some Buttermilk Beer Beignets.

Bring a small pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Use a knife to separate the leaves from the chard stems so you have 2 leaves from each stem. Thinly slice the stems crosswise.

Peel off the skins.
In a small saucepan, combine the garlic cloves, bay leaves, and oil. Simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is evenly golden brown on all sides, about 12 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and transfer the rest of the mixture to a blender (or use an immersion blender). Add the fish sauce and pepper. Blend until the mixture is smooth.
DO AHEAD: Keep in an airtight jar in the fridge for up to 2 weeks, or 2 months in the freezer. Thaw and/or stir before use.
Even though some of the spices are already ground, we will process them a second time to get a finer powder that will stick well to the chickpeas. In a spice grinder, grind the spice mix ingredients to a fine powder. Set aside.
In a deep frying pan or Dutch oven, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 2 inches (5 cm). Heat over medium-high until the oil bubbles up immediately around an inserted wooden chopstick.
Meanwhile in a large bowl, toss the chickpeas with the buttermilk and the 1 tablespoon of flour until they are evenly coated in this light batter. In a separate large bowl, mix the remaining cup (31 g) flour, the garlic powder, baking soda, white pepper, and salt. Add the coated chickpeas to the flour mixture and toss until you have a slightly wet but crumbly mixture. It may look like the chickpeas are kind of sticking together, but it’s okay.
In a large bowl, mix the garlic with 2 teaspoons of the Garlic Confit Sauce (save the rest for another day). Set aside.
Now, in several small batches as needed, add the breaded chickpeas to the hot oil and start breaking them apart with a chopstick. It’s okay if they are in small clumps of 2 to 4 chickpeas. Fry for a couple of minutes, until the chickpeas are golden brown all around. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the garlic sauce and repeat to fry the rest of the chickpeas.
Add the basil leaves to the frying oil and immediately cover the pot with a lid, leaving a small slit for the steam to escape. When the popping sound has subsided, remove the lid and fry the basil until crispy. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the bowl with the chickpeas.
Toss the chickpeas to coat them evenly with the garlic mixture, then add the spice mixture and toss until evenly coated. Season with more salt if needed.

Combine the pod, seeds, and milk in a medium saucepan and set it over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scalding. When it is almost at a simmer, turn off the heat. Place a sieve over the saucepan so that it dips into the milk but doesn’t sink to the bottom, then add the chamomile tea. Let steep for 5 minutes.
In a medium bowl, using a handheld mixer or whisk, whisk the egg yolks, honey, and sugar until thick and velvety, about 2 minutes (you should see ribbons fall from the whisk). Add the flour and custard powder, then whisk until lump-free. Remove the chamomile and vanilla pods from the milk, then slowly pour 1/2 cup (120 mL) of the hot milk into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly until combined. Add the yolk mixture back to the pan, then set it over medium-low heat. Whisking constantly, let the mixture bubble gently until you have a thick custard (take the pot off the heat and whisk to blend if lumps start forming on the side of the pan). Turn off the heat and whisk in the unsalted butter, one tablespoon at a time, until evenly incorporated. Let cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and chill in the fridge for at least 6 hours or up to overnight. The custard can be made a couple of days ahead.
With a serrated knife, remove the crust from the bread on all sides, then cut the loaf into two 5-inch (13-cm) cubes. Try to keep the edges as straight as possible.
In a large bowl, whisk the milk, egg, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. On a rimmed baking sheet, scatter a thin layer of granulated sugar. Working one at a time, dip the bread cubes in the milk mixture for just a couple of seconds on each side, then place them on a baking sheet. With a spoon, scatter a generous but even layer of granulated sugar over each side (you need a good coating to get that hardened caramel shell).
Set a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat and add enough butter to thinly coat the surface. Use a flat spatula to gently place the coated bread cubes in the skillet, then fry on each side until the sugar is golden brown and caramelized. If you see burned sugar in the skillet as you cook, remove it with a spoon. Keep adding more butter as needed.
Let the cubes cool slightly on a cooling rack (the caramel needs a couple of minutes to harden). They can be made 15 minutes before serving but no longer. Right before serving, cut out a 2-inch (5-cm) hole on one side of each cube, then remove about half of the bread from the interior (chopsticks are perfect for this job). Using a piping bag or plastic bag with a cutout hole, squeeze the chilled custard inside to fill the cavity up to the top.

Place in a large roasting tray with the garlic, thyme, Marsala, oil and salt and pepper. Rub each mushroom with the garlicky oil and cover the tray with tin foil. Place in an oven heated to 180°C (350°F) for 15 minutes, until the mushrooms have reduced in size and are soft throughout. Remove the foil, drain away the cooking liquid and set the tray on a cool surface while you prepare the rest of the Wellington.
For the onions, melt the butter with the oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. When all the butter has melted, add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions turn soft and translucent. Add the thyme, garlic and Marsala to the pan and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes until the onions are golden and caramelized all over. Remove the onions from the pan to a plate lined with paper towels to drain away the excess oil and butter. Leave to cool completely.
Next, make the pancakes. Whisk the eggs with the flour in a large mixing bowl, then slowly pour in the milk, whisking all the time until no lumps are visible. Add the chopped rosemary and season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside for 10 minutes until bubbles appear on the surface of the batter.
Warm a 26 cm. (10 in.) non-stick frying pan with a splash of sunflower oil over a medium-high heat. Pour half a ladle of the pancake batter into the pan and swirl to evenly coat the base.
Cook each pancake for a minute on each side, until lightly golden, then flip and cook the other side. The mixture should produce 6-8 thin pancakes.
Cook the spinach for a minute with a pinch of salt and a grating of nutmeg in a frying pan until bright green and just wilted. Squeeze out as much moisture as you can through a sieve, then dry on kitchen paper.
Lay out a 30cm (12 in.) piece of plastic wrap on a clean work surface, then lay 4 cooled pancakes alongside each other on the plastic wrap (you can use any extra when making the Wellington), ensuring a generous amount of overlap so that there is a continuous length down the middle of the plastic wrap. Brush the pancake all over with some of the egg yolk, then arrange the spinach down the middle of the pancakes, leaving a couple of centimeters at each end without spinach.
Place the mushrooms on top of the spinach, placing one on top of the other, giving four layers of two down the center. Top the mushrooms with the caramelized onion mixture, then use the plastic wrap to lift the pancake over the filling on either side. Fold over the ends and continue rolling until you have a tight cylinder shape. If there are any gaps, use the extra pancakes to patch up, brushing with egg yolk as you go. Wrap the pancake tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 20 minutes.
Roll out the sheet of puff pastry and brush with egg yolk. Remove the chilled pancake cylinder from the fridge and unwrap the cling film. Place in the middle of the puff pastry sheet and fold the pastry over the filled pancake to encase it completely. Crimp the sides of the pastry and brush with egg yolk all over. Scatter over the black onion seeds and cook in an oven heated to 180°C (350°F) for 25-30 minutes, until dark golden all over.
While the Wellington is cooking, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over a medium heat, then add the shallots and garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 5 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the thyme and dry sherry and bring to the boil. Reduce for 3 minutes, then add the stock. Continue to cook until the liquid has reduced by half, then add the heavy cream and turn the heat to low.

Cover and let sit overnight at cool room temperature (around or below 60°F) or in the refrigerator.
The next morning, add the ginger and the white parts of the green onions to the pot. Partially cover (a small gap is perfect to minimize evaporation and avoid a boil over) and bring to vigorous simmer over high heat. Lower the heat and gently simmer, partially covered, for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed. When done, most of the liquid will have been absorbed (you’ll see little separation between the rice and liquid). Discard the ginger and green onions. Stir the pot, cover tightly, turn off the heat, and let rest for 10 minutes to finish thickening. The desired thickness of the porridge can vary according to taste; it can be rustic and thick, or elegant and thin, or somewhere in between. If needed, add a splash of water to thin or cook a little longer to thicken. Taste and season with the salt.
When ready to serve, reheat the porridge to a simmer, then ladle into individual bowls. Garnish with sliced green onions and pepper.

Or refrigerate overnight and let the dough come to room temperature for at least 2 hours before portioning.
To portion and shape the dough, dust the counter lightly with flour and place the dough on top. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into eight pieces about 3.5 oz [100 g] each.
To shape the dough, cup the palm of your hand over one portion at a time and move your hand in a circle. The friction from the counter will help form the dough into a ball. If there is too much flour on the surface and the dough is sliding around, give the counter a spritz of water and try again. Lightly oil a rimmed tray and place the dough on the tray, ensuring that the portions are not touching. Cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap lightly coated with oil. Leave out for 1 to 1½ hours, or until puffy, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. If you refrigerate the dough, use plastic wrap to cover it and expect it to take an hour or two to return to room temperature before it is ready to be rolled out.
Dust the counter lightly with flour. Pat a portion of dough into an oval with your fingertips. Using a rolling pin and moving back and forth, roll the dough as thinly as possible into an oval about 13 by 9 in [33 by 23 cm]. If the dough resists stretching, let it relax and start working on another portion before returning to it. You can also gently stretch the dough with your hands to correct the shape. It doesn’t have to look perfect.
Place a carbon-steel wok upside down over a burner. Have a pair of tongs handy.
Heat the wok over high heat for 1 minute or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
Drape the dough over the wok. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift it easily from the wok with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for another 30 seconds.
Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, turn off the burner. The wok heats up quickly, and it will get too hot if the burner is left on.
Place a 20 in [50 cm] cast-iron griddle over two burners. Heat the griddle over medium-high heat for a few minutes or until a sprinkle of water instantly evaporates.
Drape the dough over the griddle. Cook for 1 minute or until you can lift the dough easily with tongs and it has puffed slightly and blistered. Turn the dough over to briefly cook the other side, no more than 30 seconds. For extra browning, flip it over for 30 more seconds.
Transfer the lavash to a half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough. In between batches, keep the griddle turned on, but monitor its heat so it doesn’t get too hot.
Have tongs, a pastry brush, a small bowl of vegetable oil, and 2 half-sheet pans ready. Coat one of the pans lightly with oil.
Heat a gas grill over medium-high heat or prepare a charcoal grill for direct-heat cooking. Ensure that the grill grates are clean. The grill should be hot enough that you can only hold your hand over the grates for 3 to 5 seconds. Place a sheet of dough onto the oiled pan and brush oil on top. Drape the oiled dough over the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 25 seconds. Uncover the grill. Using tongs, turn the lavash over and let it cook for another 25 seconds, uncovered, or until evenly blistered and puffed in parts.
Transfer to the clean half-sheet pan and cover with a dry kitchen towel while you cook the rest of the dough.
Eat the lavash soon after making it or store it in plastic bags to keep the bread pliable. It’s okay if it dries out and turns brittle; just rehydrate it by misting the lavash with water and covering it with a towel to let it soften. Soon after, it should be pliable enough to roll up without cracking. If it’s still cracking, mist with more water.",lavash,"['½ cup [70 g] all-purpose flour', '¼ cup plus a scant 1 Tbsp [70 ml] lukewarm water', '¼ tsp instant yeast', '1 cup [240 ml] lukewarm water', '1 Tbsp sunflower oil or other neutral oil', '2 tsp kosher salt', '3 cups plus 2 Tbsp [440 g] all-purpose flour', 'plus more for dusting']"

Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided', '1½ cups whole pecans', '1 Tbsp. pure maple syrup', 'Whipped cream (for serving; optional)']","Whisk rye flour, sugar, salt, and 1½ cups all-purpose flour in a large bowl to combine. Add butter and toss to evenly coat. Working quickly and aggressively, use your fingers to rub butter into flour to create large shaggy pieces of dough (you want some pieces of butter that are flat and thin and some that are large and chunky). Drizzle 5 Tbsp. ice water over, running your fingers through flour mixture to evenly distribute. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it should look a little dry, but add more ice water by the teaspoonful if needed, just until dough comes together).
Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times, pressing to incorporate shaggy edges and any loose bits. Dust surface and dough lightly with flour to keep dough from sticking. Using your hands, form dough into about a 7x5"" rectangle. Using your rolling pin, gently tap and press dough to compact and tidy up edges. Roll out dough, dusting dough and surface as needed, until 3 times longer than when you started. Fold dough over onto itself in thirds like a letter to make a square. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about a 12"" round. Wrap dough around your rolling pin and unfurl into a standard 9""-diameter pie dish. Gently lift dough so it slumps down into edges of dish. Trim overhang and crimp as desired. Line crust with parchment paper or foil. Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges of crust start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights. Decrease oven temperature to 350° and bake crust until edges are golden, 20–25 minutes. Remove dish from oven and brush 1 Tbsp. egg white over bottom of crust. Return to oven and bake until crust is golden brown, 5–10 minutes (the egg creates a water-resistant coating that helps prevent the custard from making the bottom soggy). Reserve remaining egg white for topping.
Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 3 days ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature.
While your crust is baking, combine eggs, egg yolk, pie filling, cream, granulated sugar, whiskey, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, 6 Tbsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. butter, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large bowl and blend with an immersion blender until smooth; try not to aerate. (Alternatively, you can whisk mixture well and blend in 2 batches in a blender until smooth and homogenous.)
Pour into crust and bake pie (still at 350°F) until filling is puffed and mostly set with just a slight wobble in the center when gently shaken, 40–45 minutes.
Just before the pie is done baking, toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8–10 minutes.
Whisk reserved egg white, remaining 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, and remaining ¾ tsp. salt in a small bowl until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add syrup and remaining 1 Tbsp. butter; whisk just to combine. Add pecans and toss to coat.
Carefully remove pie from oven and top with pecan mixture, allowing any excess egg white mixture to drip back into the bowl. Return pie to oven and bake until filling is completely set (a tester or paring knife inserted into the center should come out clean) and nuts are not tacky to the touch, 8–10 minutes.

Turn dough out onto a surface and work together with your hands, pushing and flattening until dough holds together when squeezed in your palm but some streaks of dry flour are still visible. Divide dough into 2 portions.
Flatten 1 portion of dough into an 8""-diameter disk. Cut into quarters, stack pieces on top of one another, and flatten dough with a rolling pin to about half of its original height. At this point dough should hold together with no dry spots remaining, and have nice big flakes of butter showing. Use a bench scraper or a large knife to clean any clingy bits of dough from surface. Dust surface with flour, then dust top of dough with flour. Roll out to a ¼""–⅜""-thick round. Wrap dough around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9""-diameter pie dish.

Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350°F and spread the wheat germ onto a half sheet (13 by 18-inch) pan. Toast until slightly aromatic, approximately 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature.
In a bowl, whisk together the flours, salts, and toasted wheat germ. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. Add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar and mix on low speed until the dough starts to resemble a coarse meal, 6 to 8 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough just starts to clump around the paddle or to the sides of the bowl, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. With a plastic bench scraper, bring the dough completely together by hand.
Place the dough on a surface lightly dusted with flour. Roll the dough back and forth into a cylinder. Using your fingers, pat the dough into a rectangle. Put a sheet of parchment paper the same dimensions as a half sheet pan on the work surface and dust lightly with flour. Put the dough on top.
Using a rolling pin, begin rolling out the dough. If any cracks form in the dough, stop to push them together. To keep the dough from sticking to the parchment paper, dust the top lightly with flour, cover with another piece of parchment paper, and, sandwiching the dough between both sheets of parchment paper, flip the dough and paper over. Peel off the top layer of parchment paper and continue to roll. Roll the dough into a 10 by 12- or 14-inch rectangle approximately ¼ inch thick. If the surface is uneven, roll a pastry roller across the surface to even it out.
Ease the dough and parchment paper onto a half sheet pan. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and refrigerate until firm, at least 20 minutes. Heat the oven to 350°F. Line a couple of half sheet pans with parchment paper.
Let the dough sit at room temperature for up to 10 minutes. Invert the dough onto a work surface and peel off the top sheet of parchment paper. Roll a dough docker over the dough or pierce it numerous times with a fork.
Using a 1 ¾ by 2 ½-inch (or comparable) cookie cutter, cut out the shortbread. Reroll the dough trimmings, chill, and cut out more cookies. If you don’t have a comparable cookie cutter, you can cut out the rectangles with a knife.
Evenly space 12 to 16 shortbreads on the prepared pan. Place the pan in the oven, lower the temperature to 325°F, and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake until the cookies feel firm to the touch and are slightly brown around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes more. Let the cookies cool entirely on the sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining dough.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the butter, brown and granulated sugar, and vanilla on medium-low speed just until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the peanut butter and mix until smooth. Beat in the egg. Reduce the speed to low, and gradually stir in the flour mixture until the dough comes together.
Place level tablespoons of dough about 11/2 inches/4 cm apart on the prepared baking sheets, 20 per sheet (they don’t spread much). Using a small measuring spoon with a deep well, or a melon baller, make a 1-inch/2.5 cm-diameter divot in the center of each cookie. Bake the cookies just until they are firm and turning golden brown at the edges but still very soft in their centers, about 12 minutes, rotating the sheets from front to back and top to bottom about halfway through the baking time. As soon as the cookies come out of the oven, reinforce the indentations with whatever tool you used before. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes on the pans, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Place the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH in 30-second intervals, stirring well, until smooth. Let cool slightly. Transfer the ganache to a small resealable plastic bag and work it toward the corner of the bag. Snip off a tiny bit at the corner of the bag with scissors. Fill each divot with ganache.

Mix to combine and set aside.
Cut 2 large pieces of aluminum foil and 2 large pieces of non-stick parchment baking paper. Lay 1 piece of foil on a flat surface and top with 1 sheet of baking paper. Arrange 12 of the bacon slices, overlapping slightly, on the paper. Place half the stuffing along one edge of the bacon and shape into a log. Using the foil and paper to help you, roll the bacon to enclose the stuffing, wrapping to secure. Repeat with the remaining foil, baking paper, bacon and stuffing. Place the rolls on a baking tray and roast for 20 minutes.
Place the extra sherry and honey in a small bowl and mix to combine. Remove the rolls from the foil and paper and return to the tray. Brush with the honey glaze and roast for a further 20 minutes or until crisp.

Transfer to the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes, but preferably a few hours, to dry the skin a little.
Meanwhile, heat 11/2 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan over medium heat and add the onion. Cook for 6–8 minutes, until starting to soften, then stir through the minced garlic and bay leaf. Cook for 2 minutes, then add half the pomegranate arils, the molasses, sherry and sugar. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to low and gently simmer for 10–12 minutes, until the mixture has thickened and reduced by one-third. Remove and discard the bay leaf, then remove the pan from the heat and blitz the mixture with a hand-held blender until smooth. Pass the sauce through a fine sieve to remove the aril pulp and set aside in a bowl.
Preheat the oven to 220°C (430°F) convection.
Place the red onion, garlic bulb, thyme and fennel in a large baking dish. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of the remaining pomegranate arils, drizzle over 11/2 tablespoons of oil and season with salt and pepper. Place the butterflied chicken on top of the vegetables and rub with 1 tablespoon of oil. Sprinkle over the fennel seeds, season with salt and pepper, then transfer to the oven and roast for 15 minutes or until the skin starts to turn golden. Remove the dish from the oven and baste the top of the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the pomegranate sauce. Add 250 ml (81/2 fl oz/1 cup) of water to the dish, then reduce the oven temperature to 160°C (320°F) and roast the chicken for a further 45 minutes.
Increase the temperature back to 220°C (430°F) and baste the chicken with 2 more tablespoons of sauce and add another 125 ml (4 fl oz/1/2 cup) of water to the dish. Bake for a final 6–8 minutes, until the chicken skin is dark and dry.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, dress the chopped walnuts with a little olive oil and salt.
Transfer the roast chicken and caramelized fennel and onion to a serving platter and scatter over the the remaining pomegranate arils and the dressed walnuts.

Cut off the top of the head of garlic and brush off some of the outer paper skin, leaving just the individually wrapped cloves. On a piece of foil, pour the olive oil over the garlic, then wrap the foil around it and place it in the oven for 45 minutes, until it’s completely soft. For the recipe, you’ll only need six cloves from the head, but it’s worth making a whole head to keep the rest for spreading on crusty bread or adding to salads.
Raise the oven temperature to 425˚F.
Heat the butter in an oven-proof pan over low heat. Sprinkle both sides of the fish with salt and pepper. When the butter is melted, add the halibut and put it into the oven for 10 minutes. The fish should be just cooked and opaque throughout.
While the halibut cooks, blend or food process together six cloves of garlic, the mayonnaise, and parmesan. When the halibut is done, pull it out and generously smear the mayonnaise mixture on the top. Switch the oven to a high broil and return the pan to the still-hot oven for 4 minutes under the broiler, until the top is almost entirely golden brown.
