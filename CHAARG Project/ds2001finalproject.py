Problem statemenet and background: 
CHAARG is a national organization with 10 000 members who pay dues which pay 
the salaries of its team. Retention is a crucial way to maintain memberships
and therefore dues to keep the organization running. At Northeastern, there are
200-300 members each semester. How can NU CHAARG optimize retention efforts?
Is there a correlation between event attendance and renewal rates? Are there
specific events that seem to foster higher renewal than others?
    
Introduction and description of the data:
The data is attendance and participation data recorded manually throughout the 
spring semester of 2022 by NU CHAARG's secretary. Each column is an event while
each row is a club member (the first few columns are for member information 
such as email). If a club member attended a workout, they got 2 points. 
If they attended a social, they earned 3 points. For small group events, they 
earned 1 point, etc. These points helped track attendance and club engagement. 

Methods:
This code start out by reading the data into a list of lists. 
In the split function, the data is split into equal bins in order to then 
generate two histograms: one showing members organized by percentiles of
activity rate versus renewal rate, another showing the same thing with
activity rate solely considering weekly workouts. 
Attendance data for events is also organized so that the events can be plotted
according to how many people attended them, and of those how many renewed

Results, Conclusions and Future Work:
The bar graph that includes member's engagement via attendance at all events is 
more steadily increasing and linear than the graph that only includes workouts. 
This suggests that overall club engagement may be a better indicator of
whether a member will renew or not than only weekly workout engagement. Club 
leaders could maybe focus on promoting socials and other events during the year.
The histogram containing only data about weekly workouts provides the insight
that no members who went to no weekly workouts renewed, suggesting that club
leaders should focus on making sure every member attends at least one workout
in order to increase retention. One limitation of our study is that it doesnâ€™t 
account for external factors. Some members might have not renewed for reasons 
outside of engagement or how much they enjoyed CHAARG (i.e. co-op, a busy 
schedule, dues). Workout attendance might have also been affected by external 
factors such as weather or how far the event is from campus. Future work may
account for some of these factors such as analyzing subsets of the data 
including only non-graduating members, only members who were not going on coop,
etc.
